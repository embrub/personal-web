                <h1>&loz;WELCOME</h1>
                <p>eyup, thx for clicking ! u have arrived at my monthly artdump: sachersketchbook. like many other
                    neocities netizens, i had a disconnect with social media & no longer wanted to post, yet i still
                    wanted a place to myself where i could chronologically archive all of my art. and so, this website
                    was made- a hopefully more hands-on and engaging approach to explore my hobbies & tangential
                    thoughts w/o relying on 3rd party sites. every month/two months updates with a new batch of artwork
                    i've made in that time. cool.</p>
                <p>this site is by no means a portfolio - i post all, and i mean ALL of the art i've made in that month
                    - polished art will be undoubtedly overwhelmed by colorful stress-relievers. consider this place
                    more of an informal blog than an art showcase. for a more curated experience, you can visit the <a
                        href="selected.html">selected works</a> page. otherwise, enjoy your stay!
                </p>

                    <summary>a self-reflection on this era of my artwork [& the fear of regression]</summary>
                    <p>i used to feel a lot of shame over these artworks, so much so that i almost decided not to share
                        them here.
                        not because they're bad, but because of the complete opposite- the fact that i believe these
                        arts are way more technically sound and visually appealing than what i make in 2023-24.</p>
                    <p>i think that the fear of 'getting worse' is one that's prevalent among artists, and i especially
                        had internalized this a lot in early 2023, when i started diverging from my usual art program.
                        during this time i was noticing stagnation in my 'improvement,' and i felt such panic over it,,
                        but now looking back,
                        i think that's dramatic to say. (1)well duh i'm rusty, i'm using a newer program. (2)it's
                        like. really fun to experiment. staying in the same style/techniques/program forever sounds
                        kinda
                        boring anyhow.</p>
                    <p>hiding this era's drawings seems like a shame cuz they're genuinely really good. but
                        letting them define my art now also seems like a shame too. so. we have the equilibrium.
                        acceptance~~</p>
                    <p>i feel a lot less shame looking at my 21-22 works today. my newer stuff's different, sure, but
                        calling
                        one era of work 'better' than another is just really unfair imo. simpler or more mundane doesn't
                        equate to being worse, it's a very limiting way of thinking. for what i make now, my art fits.
                    </p>
                    <p>mostly, i just want to draw my hot characters in peace.</p>
