        <h4>characters featured: callisto</h4>

        <p>i was very on the fence abt who to draw for this song. it was either darci or callisto for this one, but i
            decided to go w/
            callisto in the end bc i interpreted the song to be about a cold-hearted killer. only when i finished the
            drawing did i realize it was actually probably about sex. <i>deep sigh</i></p>
        <p>perspective is botched as hell, but i was winging it w/o references, so it is to be expected.
            admittedly it looked better while i was zoomed in and actually drawing i swear. not my best work but i had
            fun making it. &#129335;

        <h4>character featured: anton</h4>
        <p>i associate anton the most with this song- in my head i imagined a drawing of him reaching menacingly towards
            the camera. but then i just couldn’t get the pose right and then I got distracted trying to fix it and then.
            and now it looks like......... u kno. i feel like the idea for this one was better than the actual
            execution, the guts r tacky tbh but everything else is fine for what it is.
        </p>
        <p>also yea I’m aware lavender is spelled wrong but idc</p>
        <p>creepypasta song but anton yassifies it. ok.</p>

        <h4>characters featured: isra and callisto [top right & top left corners]</h4>
        <p>one of my favorites from the OC playlist's act 2, i was so happy i rolled this song. couldnt decide what
            to draw 100% so i just scribbled a bunch of misc things and this is what came out. i didn't like this art
            when i finished it at the time, but looking back now it's probably one of the better works of this month. 
            i reaaally like the complementary turqoise and reds ^o^ tho i do want to do an actual fully-rendered 
            illust based on this song when i have the time. with the proper subject matter n stuff. speaking of,
        </p>
        <p>this is a <strong>heavily</strong> callisra-coded song. not even romantic, just like world-ending dread is
            how i interpreted it... which fits a LOTTTTTT with their relationship in the present-day.

        <p>despite how it's framed, i see archer being the speaker in this drawing rather than enzo.</p>
        <p>hmm. i feel like every artwork i draw of these two is clickbait, they barely interact in canon but i always depict
            them like tragic enemies doomed forever. which is only <strong>very</strong> partially thematically 
            true..... two sides of a coin, just ghosts trying to find a place to die. ho hum.</p>
        <p>this is my favorite out of all the inktobers i managed to do (FIVE DAYS, L.) it just has a certain vibe that
            i can't decipher. whenever i draw angst, i always worry internally that it's too "tryhard" and inadvertedly
            ends up looking silly or melodramatic. i can't tell if it is the case for this art, especially in the case 
            for someone with no context story-wise. but i do very much so savor the soft helplessness that 
            i myself derive from this drawing. whateverr.
