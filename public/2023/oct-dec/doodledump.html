        <a href="images/stickynotes2.5.jpeg"><img src="images/stickynotes2.5.jpeg" class="horiz" alt="drawing done on two sticky notes. the backdrop is a neon magenta and in the foreground, is teal art of enzo, who wears a defeated expression. he is surrounded by spiral symbols which overwhelm him on his right, and on his left, is another drawing of himself and Archer."></a>
