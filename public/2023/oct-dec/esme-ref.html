        <p>WHAA ESME'S REFERENCE SHEET BUT REDONE !! this iteration looks so much better than the 
            <a href="../aug-sept/esme-doodl.html#ref">previous one</a> istg. there are two 
            versions of her outfit here bc i couldn't decide which to make canon. i like the red 
            shawl but it's reaaally annoying to render in full illustrations, so for now, the first one 
            is the main one.
        </p>
        <br id="juro">
        <p>also huhhh? new character?</p>
        <h2>juro ref</h2>
        <h3>creation date: dec 6</h3>
        <a href="images/juro-ref.png"><img src="images/juro-ref.png" alt="character reference sheet depicting a white-haired individual with spider-like appendages arching from their back, and two at the side of their head. they wear all black, with sleeves that touch the floor, and are accessorized by golden chains on their neck and arms. in their left hand, is a black staff with a green crystal."></a>
        <p>like esme, juro was a character concept i've had on the back of my mind for a looong while. 
            existing way before esme, actually. juro has a reaally 
            important role in PTC but i've never taken the time to make an actual ref sheet for them. so here 
            she is! the messenger of the gods, the interdimensional portal-weaver, and the prophet, juro^^ if you 
            remember <a href="../aug-sept/its-trinity.html">trinity</a> from last month, she would be his 
            creator and close companion.
        </p>
        <p>it felt right to put them here with esme, as their roles intertwine a lot. esme being the idealistic 
            newest demigod, searcing for a way out, and juro, ever complacient to divine fate and ensuring every 
            cycle comes full circle. theyre best friends who are going thru..... a bit of a rough patch rn.</p>
        <a href="images/esme-juro4.png"><img src="images/esme-juro4.png" alt="comic(?) panel depicting esme, holding her arm and closing in on herself, and juro who stares at her from a distance. esme asks, 'juro... why won't you tell me anything??' to which juro doesn't respond."></a>
        <p><s>juro's hair & outfit looks different in this doodle since this was before their reference was 
            finalized shhhh dw abt it</s></p>
