        <h4>characters featured: pinocchio (lies of p) & ali (OC, top right)</h4>

        <p>i had recently watched a full playthrough of "lies of p" (i wanted
            to play so bad but couldnt afford ;o;) and. oh man oh man i became
            attached QUICK. i will always love inhuman MCs with a
            complicated relationship with humanity and their creators. i love this
            game sm & the dark fantasy victorian-esque style & the dynamic bosses and. 
            i scribbled down these pencil sketches immediatly after binging the whole
            game in 2 days. i still wanna make more art of it, but first i rly need
            to figure out how to stylize p's features in my artstyle. cos rn smthn's 
            off,,,,, i dunno.</p>

            <a href="images/wme-busts.jpeg"><img src="images/wme-busts.jpeg" class="square" alt="a woman in a sweater and lab jacket smiles to the camera. the arch of her smile is exccentuated by dimples, and her eyes are upturned. seems like her expression is more sinister than genuine. the scientist's hair is tied in a high ponytail, and her right eye is covered by an eyepatch. depicted next to her is a man with deep eyebags, cropped bangs and unkept hair. he's wearing a dark dress-shirt and cross bowtie."></a>
            <br>
            <a href="images/anton-dood.jpeg"><img src="images/anton-dood.jpeg" class="vert" alt="pen sketch done on lined paper, depicting the same man in the above image, except here, he is staring blankly toward the camera."></a>
            <p>watching thru the game also reminded me of an old robot OC i also had- ali! 
                who is <i>also</i> a mechanoid boy who <span class="spoiler">
                was created in the likeliness of someone's dead son!</span> he is in 
                the top right corner of the art at the very top of the page. and above, you will see ali's <i>human</i> 
                counterpart, anton, and his creator, mrs. emerson :3
            </p>
            <p>these two are part of an old story project i haven't touched 
                in years which only ever saw the light of day in my artfight 
                profile. the only compsci rep in my stories 
                always end up as either evil or depressed, no stronger case than these 
                two inventors here. a miserable pair
            </p>
            <p>tldr; thank lies of p for making anton the dark mode mascot for this site</p>
