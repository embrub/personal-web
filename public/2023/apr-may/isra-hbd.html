        <p>ok so i actually had a shittonna trouble drawing this one lol. this piece was made in early(?) april, i
            think around the time my laptop broke down? i was tryinta speedrun re-learning ibispaintx because mspaint
            was no longer an option. & i *wanted* to learn via what i believed would be a simple portrait. and uh.</p>
        <p>simple portrait my ass???!??!?!?!</p>
        <p>this took wayyy longer than it should have lol. as the title suggests, this was supposed to be done
            in time for the character's b-day on the 25th, but instead i finished it a week after x-x (thats why the
            caption is currently "the immortal contractor" when it was originally gonna b like a happy birthday message : D)
        </p>
        <p>i used to kinda hate this piece when i finished it (there were so many alt color variations cos i was
            so unsatisfied) but like.... looking at it now i think its mega cute. the rendering is nice for the
            most part (some bits of the hair are scuffed but what can u do) and the more desaturated/dim palette
            ended up pulling thru in the end :0</p>
        <p>i think the inital frustration came from the fact i wasnt learning as quick as i wanted to. just from feeling
            it woulda been quicker in paint. when..... duh ofc its gonna take longer in ibis, its essentially a
            new program for me all over again x-x
