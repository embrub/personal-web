                <p>WOW what the fuck happened here, i dont know how i made that.</p>
                <p>especially since i started this piece like. directly after the frustration that was the isra b-day
                    portrait. and i ended up REALLY liking the proccess this piece from start to finish.
                    like i cant even give good commentary here because istg i blanked out for the entirety
                    of the creation of this, i genuinely dont know what i did here to get this drawing to this point</p>
                <p>maybeee bc this was the point in my re-learning proccess where i decided to 
                    experiment with the brushes i used (finally). i got myself some square brushes w different opacities 
                    & textures,
                    which made some bits like the hair and clothes look busier & pop more, i think :D even the lineart which i
                    like. blatantly did not respect lol. moral of the story- find brushes u like & ur art
                    abilities implode by like 10000% i guess.
                </p>
                <p>my one gripe thou is that i drew the chain on his epaulet on the wrong side. motherfucker. x-x </p>
