                <h4>character featured: archer [& enzo further down the page]</h4>
                <p>did you know that archer was created with a redemption arc in mind? despite his... kill-y tendancies, he 
                    was meant to fill the archetype of "the one left behind" - some lonely kid who died with a lot of anger 
                    in his heart, someone you wanted to see redeem himself.
                </p>
                <p>his current version though?</p>
                <p>lol. lmao, even</p>
                <p>i dunno. the longer PTC's development went on, the more his character shifted from a tragic kid 
                    to a character that was *a force of nature* - i feel like it's so common for me to exaggerate villains
                    from their original role, and for PTC i cannot decipher if the change i made for archer was a good one or not.</p>
                <p>specifically, if a character like him *needs* to be a character, or if he's okay simply being a representation 
                    of... angry, blind, unresolved death. because there are already characters who fill the role of the tragic 
                    "failure" seeking redemption (cough, cough, literally all 4 of the MCs.) and so i wonder if the villains need to 
                    be that way too. or if it's simple enough for them to be the worst of everything the MCs don't want to be. which, 
                    archer is *currently* an exaggerated embodiment of.
                </p>
                <p>one thing's for sure though, his current version is just really fun to write</p>

                    alt="a comic panel. archer stands tall and proud, preaching to enzo who is beside him, 'enzo, you would be such a great soldier if you just let your anger win, so that's why i cancelled all your therapy appointments!' enzo, hunched over in disbelief, responds, 'archer... i *needed* those.' ">
                </a>
                <p>i think i thrive off writing theatrical, overthetop characters. it's just fun to be a little un-subtle sometimes! 
                    i wouldn't be thinking so hard about it though if i didn't care about PTC's narrative. which i have 
                    become very attached to actually, and so i feel like i should simultaneously be careful about the direction 
                    these characters go in. it's tough to balance. whichever way he swings though, i will never tire of drawing the menace.
                </p>
                <p>art-wise, there's nothing much to say about these pieces. still trying and struggling to find consistent styles that i like.
