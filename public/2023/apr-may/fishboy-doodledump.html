            <h4>characters featured: enzo & archer [alive ver.]</h4>
            <p>whoah more experimental stuff !</p>

            <p>here, i was tryinta tinker w different shading styles.
                ouuuuuhhhh not gonna lie, all 3 of these mini illusts have such different vibes, i dunno which one i
                like best. i loved the proccess of drawing the bottom left portrait of enzo, though i feel like what i
                really need for all of these is some experimentation with opacity.</p>
            <p>man i miss my slightly transparent mspaint marker brush i miss her so much.</p>
            <p>anyways,</p>
            <h4>me anytime i talk about these two characters:</h4>

            <p>can you guess which is the evil and which is the baby boy</p>
            <p>ohyeah some closing words: <strong>none of these doodles are canon !</strong> :thumbs up: especially 
                archer's living design. not that it matters that much.
