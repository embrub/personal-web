                <h4>giomi's reference sheet !</h4> 
                <p>i originally made this one in mspaint before my laptop broke down, but i was ultimatly 
                    unhappy with it & decided to go over it in ibis. idk, i still think the original on the 
                    oc masterlist site has more charm, but this one is formatted better so i'm still gonna keep it, despite the fact i like the art less. 
                    this one's just one of them "it is what it is" moments.
                </p>
                <p>also, keep in mind, <strong>these are not *all* of PTC's characters</strong> (not even all the main cast). these are just the ref sheets i've completed thus far.</p>
                <h4>archer's ref !</h4>

                <p>i decided to put archer and enzo's refs here too, also made in ibis. man i didnt know how tf to shade these
                    things. i get that ur not rlly suppoused to shade reference sheets but they looked far too plain without it. 
                    i had so much trouble with these guhh,,, the time in total for all three was easily 40+ hours.
                </p>
                <h4>enzo's ref !</h4>
                <p>i almost didn't include his helmet in this, im still debating whether or not i wanna keep it or not. either 
                    that or i need to redesign the suit to work better with it ;o; because in certain angles, it is hell to 
                    figure out. whatevaaahhhhh whatevaaaa
                </p>
