                <p>k so. while the isra hbd portrait was a style test for illustration, i was tryinta see what a panel of a comic might look like if drawn very loosely here. like,
                    ive done comics in this program before, but i wanted to find a style that'd allow me to finish
                    panels *quickly* ...cos the older sequential stuff ive done in ibis before (i.e. BOCT) -
                    they were very pretty but they took wayyyyyy too long to do. like. dont even talk to me.
                </p>
                <p>as for this piece's function as a style test, it kinda failed tbh LOL. i do not like the
                    style of this thing x-x</p>
                <p>i was going for a messy lineart, v angular, limited undos type of thing? but the anatomy of the
                    characters looks *off* to me because of it? the shapes aren't the type i would normally like to 
                    see in a comic of mine? too long & skinny & rectangular if that makes any sense. i dunno, just 
                    seems endlessly off for reasons i cannot articulate, but that's ok, cos now i know what to avoid 
                    at all costs next time. BRO i couldn't even nail the color scheme, i had to put so many damn 
                    filters on this thing to finally be satisfied guhhh
                </p>
                <p>archer looks alright though, all things considered. what a silly guy.
