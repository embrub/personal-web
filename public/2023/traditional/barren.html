        <p>this was sometime before i started free-handing all my traditional art.
            the first drawing was actually the last fully sketched + purposefully lined artwork i drew in my sketchbook.
            the second art was my first attempt at free-handing, but it's obvious i haven't stepped outta my comfort 
            zone yet at this point in time. too clean,,,,,
