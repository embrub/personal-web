                <p>this page spread was around the time where i decided, fuck it, i wanna be looser with my sketchbook.
                    it took finding other artists with messier, more "expressionist" styles for me to really be OK with 
                    making a mess outta mine too.
                </p>
                <p>i went into this one without a sketch & basically free-handed everything. 
                    & turns out, i enjoy that proccess wayyyy better than the process of purposeful lineart. also 
                    truns out i like gel pens - the tacky kind that drip a little and the ones that are rough on 
                    your paper.

                <p>heheh also while i was drawing this, i'd found an old watermark i used in 2019 when i was still
                    posting art for the danplan fandom (rest in peace). "FERAL GARY" lmao i miss that place sm u dont
                    even know.
                </p>
                <p>i taped it in my sketchbook for good measure, didn't wanna lose this ancient relic</p>
