                <p>it's a drawing of my sona, accompanied by some lyrics of "dreaming of exactly where i am,"
                    from "EMERGENCY!" by Devi McCallion / girls rituals / blacksquares / etc.

                <h4>to the left is that song, and fuck it, the entire album for good measure bc i think it deserves the spotlight.</h4>
                <p>i made the above art immediatly after leaving uni for winter break, having been thru the worst mental rut
                    ever, actually. just terribly paranoid yet somehow so detatched all of the time, and thru it all i
                    had found an album that had perfectly described that feeling in audio form - "EMERGENCY!" ..or maybe
                    it didn't and i just ended up projecting, but nonetheless it borderline kept me sane thru the fall
                    semester, all the way to winter break. whenever i was feeling shit, i'd leave my dorm, plug my
                    headphones in, and wander the campus with this album on loop. theraputic asf, especially on
                    nightwalks.
