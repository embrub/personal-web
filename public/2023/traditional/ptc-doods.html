                <p>omg its the main cast being silly !!! ouugh i love them so sooo much
                    eheuehehe !! i scribbled this one up while bored during the summer. nothing too
                    much to say abt this one tbh, its just cute imo</p>

                <p>anyways, the other half of the page spread !</p>

                    alt="drawing of a man holding a trident in a sort of dynamic pose. the page is decorated with a wheat stem taped into it, and some collaging photos.">
                </a>
                <p>a lot of collaging in this one ! i drew enzo first and then was scared to doodle anything else on the
                    page bc i liked that one drawing too much lol.
                </p>
                <p>i wrote the lyrics to "sabotage everything" by ada rook on this page, even thou the lyrics
                    could not relate less to enzo as a character lol. it was just what i was listening to that as i drew
                    it.</p>
                <p>it is, ofc, a banger.</p>

                <p>i'd considered showcasing the two pages in seperate webpages but then the 1st page would be so empty cos
                    i dont have jack to say abt it ;o;</p>
