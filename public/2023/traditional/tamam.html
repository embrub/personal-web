                <p>these were some OCs i designed from some randomizer prompts i drew alongside the sister. one joke led to
                    another and now one of them is a hello neighbor OC. i really like them both ngl, milkman is my 
                    favorite, and the mannequin's silhouette ended up pretty nice too, despite how generically in 
                    my comfort zone his outfit is ;o;
