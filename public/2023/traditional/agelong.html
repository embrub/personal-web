                <h4>character featured: enzo</h4>

                <p>dsfdsfasd my favorite page spread. i drew it soon after an exam as a stress-reliever & so
                    intended for a more free-form loose and flow-y linework to get out tht emotion. suprisingly it ended 
                    up looking real nice imo</p>
                <p>to the left is a vague reference "on the quiet" by one leg mary. please listen to the album pleasepleaseple</p>

                <h4>characters featured: tamari & miriyam [from qualia automata]</h4>
                <p>i was going thru huge brainrot for the song series, qualia automata at this time. ive never been so 
                    excited for the release of a song ever tbh. hhhhh still on the edge of my seat for part 4's release</p>

                <p>OK A SLIGHTLY UNRELATED TANGENT ON QUALIA AUTOMATA: </p>
                <p>
                    my favourite character's tamari, but i'm more interested in miriyam, mainly bc i think they have a
                    lotta potential. as much as i love the song and its plot tho, end-world normopathy ended up focusing
                    more on miriyam's relationship with <em>tamari</em>, and so
                    i feel like i have a limited understanding on <em>miriyam</em> as a person. so i really hope the next
                    one goes more in depth with their own goals. like i GET her being an emotionless and sheltered
                    android is the point of her character, but i wanna see more of her !!! especially now that they've
                    experienced some level of emotions now. GUHHHHHH i really hope they get their time to shine.... bc i
                    wrote in the drawing too that i'm afraid they're gonna die in part 4. the extra lore blurb on team
                    6x111's website gave her so many death flags mannnnn ;o;
