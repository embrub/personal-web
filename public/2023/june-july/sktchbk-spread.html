title="[transcript - far right] all the pink on the prior page reminded me of Ali & so i just had to draw him here. Tbh it's been so long that I entirely forgot how to draw his hair ;o; His outfit is actually so fun tho! Also unlike the previous pages, I actually used a sketch before I lined & tbh idk how I feel abt it. rip.
