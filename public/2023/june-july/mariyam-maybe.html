                <p>ok so. this was supposed to be fanart of mariyam from qualia automata but the filters i put on at the
                    very end made her hair brown brooo. guess its not mariyam anymore &#128557;&#128557;
                </p>
                <p>other than that, this was meant to be a simple painting experiment. i like the textures but if you asked me
                    to replicate them i would go blank lol.</p>
