        <p>i don’t usually do page spreads with multiple figures on the canvas, so ig in that way, this artwork was a
            little out of my comfort zone? Makes sense tho, because i think this piece was one of the more “mid” works of
            june-july. I think i could have filled up the page more, but it’s whatever. i don’t remember which brush i used,
            but i recall it being real nice to work with, so it wasn’t all a waste. i had fun with it, i was giddy with
            it.
        </p>
        <p>i mostly worked on these in the late hours
            of the night when i couldn't sleep, nothing too artistically significant about them.
            along w some general boredom relief, i was also trying to figure out what clothes enzo could wear under his
            uniform and how they'd work w his hugeass tail. it did its job, but i eventually gotta make a
            reference sheet for this fit. Noooo.........
