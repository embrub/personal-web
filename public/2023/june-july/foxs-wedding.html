                <p>y'know that one masa works design song? yea. tbf i don't really associate the fox's wedding w these characters, it was just what i was listening to as i
                    was drawing, and it became a very short-lived inspo for this page. caption makes no sense as a result
                </p>
                <p>the page looks OK but i think i drew archer's face too long lol, he looks abit older here than he actually is ;o;
                </p>
                <p>also, slightly relevant bonus doodle !</p>

                        alt="a two-panel comic featuring archer in the first panel, arms outstretched as if preaching. in the second panel, lyre watches him. the two panels are captioned, 'you have a hole where your heart once was. a risk i must contain.'"></a>
                <p>lyre really saw the most morally unhinged man alive and went, "i can fix him."</p>
