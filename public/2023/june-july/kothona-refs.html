        <p>nothing much to say about these artistically actually. i made this ref sheet for artfight and
            ended up redesigning them a tad.
        </p>
        <p>im p happy with em, except kothona's design is the only one i feel abit iffy about........ i think she ended
            up looking boring in comparison to the others. tbf she looked a lot more complex as i was doing the lineart-
            i think her character is recognizable from her silhouette/shapes but the colors man.. i
            dont know what to add to make it pop more, bc i SWEAR it's missing something.</p>
        <p>i'll probably reminisce on it for abit.</p>
