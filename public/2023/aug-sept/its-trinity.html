            <p>ugh who tf is this loser ?!</p>
            <p>not rly a new character, i just redesigned her a bit. trinityyyy: god of
                something. dont ask her, she doesnt know ! shes just the sacrificial lamb~</p>
            <a href="images/trinity-ref.png"><img src="images/trinity-ref.png" class="vert" alt="trinity reference sheet"></a>

            <p>hhh she's one of those characters i love to think about but hate to write.
                kinda like enzo actually, haha. shes so frustrating, i wanna
                grab her by the shoulders and shake her like "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ON ABOUT?!",,
                as if i am not the author making her do these things.
            </p>
            <p>ah...... fun fact, her name being "trinity" is actually leftover from when ptc
                was still a jsab au. yeah.. remember apu? haha..... apu..............
            </p>
            <p><i>[i stare longingly into the distance, and exgale a long and grated sigh, 
                    a thousand years' contained anguish flee my body like damned souls out hell.
                    but of course, it is impossible, and the chains yank the hellscorned neck once more,
                    choking and sputtering, return to hell. and i inhale.]

            <p>apu...................................</p>

            <img src="images/man.png" alt="low-quality meme depicting a horse on a beach staring into the distance,">

            <p>yeah anyways, on one fateful late night, i was thinking abt it a bit and the thought 
                there may be a slim possibility that she could be interpreted as a jesus analogy made me 
                shit my pants in fear. i need to change her name. shes not even jsab-related anymore why 
                is she called trinity.......................
            </p>
            <p>ahh oh yeah, another fun fact about her new design iteration - she has a sundial halo ! 
                she's a sundial, isnt that quaint.</p>
