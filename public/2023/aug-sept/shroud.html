            <h4>character featured: callisto</h4>
            <p>i just realized i made his head too big and it's too late to change it, oh well.
            <p>ok so, this is a redesign of an old costume change for callisto. once again, AM continues to be historically 
                inaccurate to its inspirations.. what even time period is this meant to be? who cares,  
                i added a cool veil !
            </p>
            <p>i don't know what compelled me to wanna change the old version, but i do think that 
                lore-wise it makes more sense for him to be covering his face while outside the ring. 
                also the hat ties the outfit together nicely, i always felt like smthn was missing,, 
            </p>
            <p>heres the old version for comparison:</p>

            <p>what the fuck are those shoes though</p>
