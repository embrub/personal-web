            <p>aaa new character alert</p>
            <p>i've had this character concept on the backburner for ages and finally
                created a design for her. she was just meant to be a background character for ptc- one of the
                minigods- but once again i have become increasingly attached to a one-off design and am thinking
                of more places to put her in the story ;o;
            </p>
            <p>i unexpectedly ended up rly liking her, but since i created her so quickly, i find myself drawing her a
                little differently every time. i either end up forgetting little parts of her costume or just changing
                the shape of her hair ever so slightly ;o;o;o;o; like in some arts on this month's blog i think i
                straight up didn't draw her halo ;o; grahhhh i'll eventually get used to drawing her
            </p>

            <a href="images/esme-doodl.jpeg"><img src="images/esme-doodl.jpeg" class="vert" alt="a portrait of a dark-skinned girl wearing a timid expression. she has piercing white eyes, turquoise hair and a halo hovering over her head."></a>
            <p>i don't think this one was clean enough to have its own page dedicated to it. so 
                i put it here instead. yippee !! esmesmeesmee i want to pinch her cheeks</p>

            <h3 id="ref">creation date: aug 26</h3>
            <p>and now heres her ref sheet. i rly need to update it, theres a few things i consider out of date already</p>
            <a href="images/esme-ref.png"><img src="images/esme-ref.png" id="ref" alt="esme reference sheet"></a>
            <p>some things i need to make clearer for refsheet redo (lol its so much):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>her little horns r meant to be corals :,D</li>
                <li>the diamond on her chest is a supernatural/symbolic force. (like the one archer has above his head)
                    it floats around her and it's not what's pinning her cape together</li>
                <li>the red transparent ring around her is a shawl</li>
                <li>she's a nurse shark i think! i might change it to lantern shark to fit her lore better tho.</li>
                <li>HER HAIR NEEDS TO BE CURLY HELPPPPP IDK WHY I DREW IT LIKE THAT............</li>
