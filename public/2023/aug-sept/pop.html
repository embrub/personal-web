            <h4>characters featured: archer and. i guess enzo.</h4>
            <p>this one was inspired by a gif of someone breaking a doll with some comic-style onomonopias 
                overlaid onto it. i cant find the original rn.
            </p>
            <p>hmm. cell shading knocks the wind out of me and i could not be assed to clean this one up.
                i think the. atmosphere and the framing is nice but i also think there is  
                a lot more to be desired here :( </p>
            <p>all things considered, i think it's a neat concept still, just needs to 
                be utilized better. i might redraw/revisit it later.
            </p>
