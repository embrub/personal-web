            <p>just a silly little shitpost, nthn too serious.</p>
            <p>hhh these two have the weirdest rivalry man, they *have* to fight cos their missions call for it but
                they also don't take the other seriously and would rather avoid each other at every turn.  
                esme pities archer, and archer thinks she is nosy and immature. stalling, they r stalling 
                the inevitable.
            </p>
            <p>i would elaborate more, but the specifics are not completely ironed out and i do not want to take back my words,</p>
            <p>alternate version:</p>
            <a href="images/ermmm.png"><img src="images/ermmm.png"
                alt="same image as the previous, just with different colors"></a>
            <p>i like the colors in this alt version way better, but i like the composition of the 1st one better, 
                i cant win w this piece.</p>
