            <p>it was late, like 2AM late, and i couldnt sleep. so i just started binging
                a bunch of black dresses' live shows. i doodled this one rq while watching
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujJEXXqJaIk">this clip</a> !
                referenced from around the 3:40 mark. so sill ay.
            </p>
            <p>dude i loved the crunchy blocky high-saturation look of this, but whenever i tried
                to replicate the style again i just couldnt do it. ahhh what a shame,
            </p>

            <p>haha... i said back in an <a href="../apr-may/manslaughter.html">older entry</a>
                that i wasn't sure whether i wanted to give archer an actual character
                or not. and after reminiscing about it these past few months i believe i have
                found a balance. won't elaborate on specifics, but the idea that he was alive
                once has been such a super fun exercise in writing. i think giving this aspect
                of his character more light has changed a lot abt how i envision his role in 
                the story actually.

            <p>i dont know how tf i made all of these drawings in one day, especially this one lmao.
                i really do like the colors in this one but theres still smthn i find a bit embarrassing abt this
                piece. drawing out angst is admittedly rly out of my comfort zone even tho i write/think abt it
                so much. this drawing is so silly to me somehow. is it too edgy?? idfk man iiii uhhh</p>
            <p>ember try not to over-use red star motifs with every ptc oc challenge: impossible.</p>
