                    <p>oh mannnn how have two months gone by so fast yet so excruciatingly slowly. guh....... tis what the
                        start of a semester does to a mf.</p>
                    <p>honestly i created a suprisingly large amount of finished pieces in these 2 months, but it really
                        doesn't feel like that at all. im p stumped rn cos i remember nOTHING lol. it's all gotta have 
                        been from august, i was busy as helllll in september, aint no way.
                    </p>
                    <p>all in all though, i can say that i've become a lot more confident with using ibis now-- i know which
                        tools i prefer and can replicate a bunch of coloring styles that i *actually* enjoy using, despite
                        not having one i consistently stick with. it's nice to finally know my way around the program,
                        especially after the wimpy flat-colored phase of artwork i produced at the end of june-july. 
                        (june-july wasn't even that bad, i just didn't know what kinda art i wanted to make and it 
                        frustrated the hell outta me lol.)
                    </p>
                    <p>but now that that's done and over with, i think the next best step for me is to focus on the basics
                        again. like anatomy, which i feel like ive been getting kinda lazy at in favor of colors and
                        rendering. infact, quite a lotta pieces compiled here actually have either visible anatomy errors or
                        are cases where i had to repaint over them to fix things i didn't catch at first. i've been
                        attempting at getting outta same-face syndrome a LITTLE in doodles i've refrained from sharing.  
                        SFS isn't smthn i think is a serious problem (art&#8594; subjective, whateverrrrrr) it's just that, i've 
                        discovered lately that when i'm not rendering, i feel BORED when i'm drawing... which isn't great 
                        lol. i took it as a sign i need to diversify what i draw more, though we'll see if i follow through 
                        on any of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>OH YEAH, in addition. for once i compressed my images for this batch of artwork ;o; ;o; ;o; i..... didn't used to 
                        do that for the other ones. i have decent internet so images would always load pretty well, so i have no 
                        idea if compression did any difference for users w slower internet. hope it does tho. i always get v 
                        flustered over altering my images.

                <p>i've been playing this single split on looooop since it's released. real funky, real feelgood
                    imo.</p>

                <p>slightly related tangent,,</p>
                <p>these(?) songs released around the time i started reading this comic, "<a href="https://matikhluk.neocities.org" target="_blank">matikhluk</a>" by 74756re (big
                    reccommend btw). and bc of the timing, i ended up associating the two medias with each other!
                    they fit each other sososo well though it's not even funny. dogbreath is a nin&lani-coded song istg.
                </p>
                <p>mann. i dont know how to describe this genre of art whether it be music, or visual mediums, or
                    whatever, that's just so,, aloof and kinda sluggish but kinda surreal. but whatever it is,
                    i'm a big fan. i love mtkhlk, i love dark city/dogbreath. excited to see more britney cage
                    in the future aswell, im so intruiged.
