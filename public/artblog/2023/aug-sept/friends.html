            <p>hehe i think they would be friends, that is all.</p>
            <p>just some self-indulgent stuffs. drawing the mini/demigods being buddies make me very soft inside. 
                we have an eternity to live out, might aswell live it w each other, u kno? they r children. 
                mere children.

                *here* completely by chance. ahhh... idk how i feel abt it. it's just cute, it's not my best 
                piece, not my worst :,)
