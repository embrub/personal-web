                <h3>final thoughts:</h3>
                <p>i'm a sucker for visual cohesion, so even though a lot of these could have gone in the previous
                    batch, one half of july's artwork just looked so distinctly different from the other that i figured
                    it'd make more sense to save them for here. so here we are. a good chunk of the stuff in this batch 
                    was made alongside artfight last month.</p>
                <p>i feel very neutral about the artwork this time around. i consistently had a blast drawing all of
                    them, but it's hard for me to extend the same love to the visuals themselves and not just the process
                    if you catch my drift? drawing has always been and will forever be fun to me, but after last month's
                    batch where i consistently completed several planned and intentionally meaningful artworks (black hole
                    heart, fanta, good things), it became very hard for me to start drawing after that. i
                    wanted to replicate the same polish and intrigue but had nothing i felt were "good ideas,"
                    constantly having the urge to draw but with nothing really to say. so yeah, i drew in these months 
                    because it's fun, but i don't think any of these are very intuitive or provoking in any way, although 
                    they are pretty fun to look at and were VERY fun to draw. much mixed messaging in this batch.
                </p>
                <p>i've also been re-reading over a bunch of old commentary and microblog entries and having a
                    mini-crisis about whether what i write here is meaningful enough to warrant taking up space on the site.
                    i really want to be intentional with what i put out, whether it be art or my own rambles. cuz while
                    i do still want to show my personality shamelessly, i also think i have a lot
                    of serious ideas that i want to be expressed more quietly and subtly too. 
                    the mission statement of this site from the very start has been to archive ALL of my art, polished 
                    or not, and i'll see how far i can stretch it all.

                <p>been making my way thru more of clipping's discog and this one has been on my mind all thru 
                    september omfg. felt like i was sat thru a movie for 
                    the whole thing and it all went by so fast.</p>
                <p>it's an experimental hip-hop album about a man who flees a world where humanity had been enslaved  
                    as his ship's AI becomes sentient. rly atmospheric and immersive. i feel so insane about this, one billion recommends be your way.
