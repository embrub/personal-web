        <!-- <p>i don't like the quote that this art is based off of. i guess i kept on feeling like something was missing -
            like yeah man why DONT you step away? what was it that was so dreadful that it
            kept you inside? urkkkk i'm coping and malding.</p> -->

            
        <p>this artwork was based off a quote that i hate, so it was made out of spite pretty much. i tried elaborating 
            on what it means to me but i can't find a way to word it in a way where it does NOT sound like extreme 
            cope. you can figure out the pieces maybe. i make it sound really intense here but it's not. 
            kinda just wanted to draw a thousand-yard-stare tbh. 
        </p>
        <p>the art itself is not to my liking here, i had a grand plan and it was meant to be a lot more 
            elaborate and rendered but halfway through i lost interest. oops.
