        <a href="images/brainrot.PNG"><img src="images/brainrot.PNG" class="horiz" alt="digital collage of enzo doodles, all flat-colored and done in highly-saturated palettes, reminiscent of pop art. in the top left, enzo lays in a coffin whilst smiling, captioned: 'letting T.D.E.R. lower me into the grave so they can let me down one last time.' in the top right artwork, enzo looks forward in panic while archer looms behind him, reaching over his shoulder. captioned: 'how fake loyalists look when the REAL loyalists come at them.' the final artwork is of my sona slapping enzo, parodying the chris rock/will smith slap. the canvas is also cluttered in memes and reaction images alongside the artwork"></a>

        <p>a doodle page! i didn't know what else to draw in the bottom left corner so i filled it with reaction images from my folder. this truly is brainrot: the canvas.</p>
        <p>what's the deal with...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what's TDER (top left)? loreeeee: it's "the department of ethics and reason" - the intergalactic peacekeeping organization! enzo's fucking planet is gone so it's safe to say they didn't do their job.</li>
            <li>OKAY. i can explain the bottom right one: a friend wanted me to draw art of me slapping enzo and so i DID. everyone can clock that he is my favorite stress toy.</li>
        </ul>
            <img src="images/squeak.png" alt="artwork of my sona, who squeezes a tiny enzo in her hand like a stress toy.">
            <p>^^^^ doodle of myself and him, circa 2022. tale as old as time.</p>
        <h3>bonus doodle</h3>
        <a href="images/pancreatic-cancer.PNG"><img src="images/pancreatic-cancer.PNG" alt="a take on the sponging out meme. 'sorry pancreatic cancer but i don't think you qualify as an emotion.' 'bullshit, you let enzo castor in.' 'bro i'm literally existential guilt and dread.'"></a>
