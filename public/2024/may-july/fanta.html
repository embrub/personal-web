        <p>this is the 2nd drawing in this batch that's inspired from a song from laughingfish. admittedly the sound's not my *thing* but it has a weight that i'm unfamillar to and it leaves me with a bit to think about. i hope BD had fun making it</p>

        <p>lyre looked less angry in the OG sketch but i think the final looks more compelling overall, even tho it no longer matches the inspo song.</p>
