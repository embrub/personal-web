        <p>texture abuse..... i just remembered i could do this</p>
        <p>this was the part in the month where i realized how late in the game i was and still havent gotten around to many of my bookmarks &#128557; i'd just been revenging for 90% of the event, and in the last week or so of AF i went hard. this and the following entries r home to my favorite works from the month.</p>

        <p>oh man i love these goobers. i wanted to attack first but homegirl beat me to it. the silly little mailman is dressed in a corset, i'm afraid he is the only one SERVING in this war, the others outta be emberassed. cringe-ass french caption. funny little mail and wishbone stamp. i'm sure i could bullshit up a reason for them.</p>
        <p>last panel was a plesant challenge to pull off, it looks much more vibrant un-compressed, im saddened by how much i needed to nerf the quality urkkk</p>

        <p>ohhhh this one's my absolute favorite. i was so frustrated with the art at first but then then they fire back at me with the nicest comments imaginable and then suddenly it's one of my favorites from this season LOLLL. actually perfect and impeccable timing as i'd felt myself falling into artblock ackkkkk do you know how near and dear keymash comments are????? golden, this is what AF is all about man, so many insanely cool users w insanely cool stories to share in inspo, oh man. perpetual motion machine perpetual motion machine per</p>

        <p>i just really like the character man, all of my character design biases in one: mild-mannered, monochromatic, long flowy clothes, answers to some kind of devout cause. i woulda loved to give something more rendered. curse the end of the month.</p>
