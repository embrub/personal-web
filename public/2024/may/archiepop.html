        <h4>characters featured: archer & esme</h4>
        <p>it is what the title sayssss. these two were quick doodles, not much to say about em, i just think theyre cute.</p>
        <p>day by day it feels like i have less time to draw, so the lasso tool became a v quick way to speed up my art proccess. i've been using it a lot this month and been digging the crisp, sharp look that it can produce. kinda gives a paper collage feel, if you know what i mean.</p>

        <a href="images/urk.jpg"><img src="images/urk.jpg" alt="a collection of high-saturation pen and highlighter doodles of archer. each batch featuring various poses and facial expressions."></a>
        <p>didn't know where else to put this one. urk it's a freeform sketchbook spread to get my mind off work. it's doodles of archer but you can hardly tell lol</p>
        <p>out of all the polished drawings i could have sent, i gave this one to my school's illustration club LMAOOO. it was for a little prompt event idk. i was listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/i-r1yhDQRFs?si=gob0zWCrndrSq5wV" target="_blank">this song</a> as i drew. weep, for no one can possibly comprehend my sophisticated and curated music taste.</p>
        <p>also fyi, that's a sticker i found under a lunch table, i could never join a sorority, eep.</p>
