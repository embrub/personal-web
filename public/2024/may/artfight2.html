        <p>texture abuse..... i just remembered i could do this</p>
        <p>this was the part in the month where i realized how late in the game i was and still havent gotten around to many of my bookmarks &#128557; i'd just been revenging for 90% of the event, and in the last week or so of AF i went hard. this and the following entries r home to my favorite works from the month.</p>

        <p>oh man i love these goobers. i wanted to attack first but homegirl beat me to it. the silly little mailman is dressed in a corset, i'm afraid he is the only one SERVING in this war, the others outta be emberassed. cringe-ass french caption. funny little mail and wishbone stamp. i'm sure i could bullshit up a reason for them.</p>
        <p>last panel was a plesant challenge to pull off, it looks much more vibrant un-compressed, im saddened by how much i needed to compress it it urkkk</p>

        <p>i just really like the character man, all of my character design biases: mild-mannered, monochromatic, long flowy clothes, answers to some kind of devout cause. i woulda loved to give something more rendered. curse the end of the month.</p>
