        <p>DAMN this was so fun to draw. unBELIEVEBLY so. do you SEE this shit?</p>
        <p>idea of a more malevolent extension of <a href="../../2023/aug-sept/experiments.html">this old idea</a> (doodle no.3 / look at u look at me). at this point i have cycled thru SEVERAL iterations of archer's character in varying degrees of evilness and i'm still tryinta figure things out. the idea of his post-death self being an intrusive, unwanted mockery of his younger self is a nice one i think. every day we stray further from the original intent.</p>
        <p>alternative title: why doesn't the big archer just eat the little archer?</p>
