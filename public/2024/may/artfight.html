        <p>OHHHH THIS CHARACTERRRR...... bitch u knowww i am a sucker for corrupt government storylines. for some odd reason the simplicity of the design was difficult to adapt into my own artstyle and i became so saddened by this. this chara compells me, i wanted to do him justice. luckily it came out super nice ToT ..i might be back next year, there is a soldier on my radar.</p>

        <p>cursedvalk had so many cool space-themed ocs i would have loved to draw, it was so hard deciding which to pick. i said i would attack again but i never got around to it, will def be coming back next year. a red dwarf is staring straight thru my crosshair. speaking of red dwarf.. i tried to look up 'parodytwt' to get more context to their lore, but all i found was a depressed DSMP tubbo RP blog, YEAH I DONT THINK I FOUND THE CORRECT PARODYTWT&#128557;&#128557;&#128557;&#128557;</p>
