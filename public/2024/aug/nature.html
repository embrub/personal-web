        <p>i'm on a poppy re-listening spree. this art was inspired by this specific song:</p>

        <p>how incredibly oc-brained of me to hear a song and then immediately assign a character to it LOL. anyways. 
            the lyrics so strongly mirror what i imagine anton thinks of himself and what he expects of his creation, ali, 
            who is MEANT to be this perfect evolution of himself. guess who stays cold and robotic 
            and who grows a conscience :D :D :D "isn't it strange to create something that hates you?"
            ughhh i love anton, i think he's fascinating.</p>
