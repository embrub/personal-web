        <!-- <p>really stark contrast to the previous drawing in the gallery i think.</p> -->
        <p>this was an older drawing i started in early july and finished in october. i didn't intend for it to be a
            fully-rendered illust, rather it began as an un-serious doodle. when it started getting more and more detailed, the
            foundations weren't there, and so the facial features ended up looking very off in the end. it's alright, but
            it doesn't really look like <i>enzo</i> to me.</p>
        <a href="images/worms.PNG"><img src="images/worms.PNG" alt="digital flat-colored artwork of enzo. he offers a bowl of pink mush to the viewer. captioned, 'we outta MREs. worm soup.'"></a>
        <p>this above one, however, is the best and most accurate enzo i've ever drawn and it was a shitpost i drew in like 10 
            minutes. worm soup...

        <a href="images/lakeside.PNG"><img src="images/lakeside.PNG" alt="digital warmup sketch of enzo, predominantly done in deep purples and oranges. enzo is waist-deep in the sea, extending a gentle hand to the viewer while smiling warmly. it's nighttime, the sky behind him is pitch black and is illuminated only by a dim eclipse."></a>
