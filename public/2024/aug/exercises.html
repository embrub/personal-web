        <h4>characters featured: otis, enzo, giomi</h4>
        <p>did you know that ball-jointed dolls' heads are attached with a hook? that's so quirky.</p>
        <p>the title says "exercises" but i really hesitate to say they are real studies... i looked at references
            occasionally, sure, but i mostly just wanted to have fun with the lasso tool. i started drawing these 
            and the artworks below after realizing that i drew these three ocs off-model all the time. (i think u can 
            tell from various artworks in this months' batch) i figured it'd be helpful to try and draw
            half-nudes: them at their complete bare-bones. that's why i also excluded their scars for this 
            particular art. need to redo otis's refsheet too cuz it's very outdated to how i currently envision his figure.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>these next drawings were done first chronologically and was meant to act as body reference sheets...
            but i already don't like them at all and want to redo them lol. the drawing above completely rendered these
            outdated but i figured i'd show em off anyways.</p> -->

        <p>as mentioned before, these are outdated. gio's crotchpiece is too big here and her arms in reality have two ball
            joints instead of one. i really do need to study ball-jointed-dolls more, cuz depending on the way the
            joints bend, the balls are covered completely or not at all. need to give her a ref sheet that actually makes sense.</p>

        <p>don't like this last one, need to redo this one.</p>
