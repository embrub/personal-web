        <p>otis design explorations yayyy</p>
        <p>top image is from the a concept i’ve had in my head for a long while: during moments of extreme emotion (usually anger), 
            his hair will turn into flames, emitting a rly thick black sparkly smoke. the intent was for his horns to resemble
            chimneys too but it didn’t come across right.</p>
        <p>bottom ones are more miscellaneous explorations. wanted to try incorporating some dragony(?) imagery with
            him, not really going into it intending for anything to stick, just testing my ideas. 
            decided in the end a lot of it is non-canon.</p>
        <a href="images/design-exploration.PNG"><img src="images/design-exploration.PNG" class="horiz" alt="lineless illustrations of otis which reveal his chest and back, his back which is spotted in black scales which form a line down his back and neck. sticking out of his chest is a pink crystal."></a>
        <br>
        <a href="images/design-exploration2.png"><img src="images/design-exploration2.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>the claws and arm scales look nice but wouldn't rly work since he has to wear gloves in canon. i like the
            idea a LOT though, maybe i'll change my mind about it. the stuff on his back and chest IS in the story thou,
            they're an "infection" from when he was stabbed with what was essentially a battery. the horns are a part of
            it, actually.</p>
        <a href="images/dumb.PNG"><img src="images/dumb.PNG" alt="highly-saturated drawing of otis, blood dripping down his mouth and chest while smiling to the camera. in the background is a figure engulfed by flames, holding their head and screaming. captioned: 'dumb bitch just stabbed me with my power source.'"></a>
