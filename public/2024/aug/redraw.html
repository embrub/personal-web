        <p>i found old art of isra that i'd redrawn last year once already n i wanted to draw it again.
        </p>
        <p>the pose looks pretty basic here but it was actually SO hard to nail. a lot of weird details accumulated into an overall odd pose: 
            head tilted slightly down, body turned, shoulders lifted up, both arms bent but at different angles and holding different objects... 
            i had to redraw it so many times cuz the arm facing the camera looked too stiff/uncomfortable. still kinda does in a way, but 
            i still think the final result is neat. better than the last ones anyway LOL
