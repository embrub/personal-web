        <!-- <p>hi, welcome to sachersketchbook.neocities.org/2024/aug/<strong>die</strong>, which is how i feel right now showing this</p> -->

        <p>ok so there's this wonderful artist named qae0 on twitter dot com who made an elegant and beautiful poster of their OC leaning 
            back and being held by phantom hands and i tried to copy it but the vibe is. so totally lost. so totally gone.
        </p>
        <p>that being said, i wish i could say more about this one. visually, it is my favorite artwork from this batch but i really did 
            just freehanded most of it..... i used a wet square brush and shaded directly on top of the flat colors and the lineart itself was 
            just a cleaned-up sketch. visuals slap indescribably yet i wish i didn't have so many mixed emotions about the rest of the piece. 
            the pose isn't even that bad but i feel so embarrassed by this subject matter LOL. this is straight up a pinup. okayyyyy
