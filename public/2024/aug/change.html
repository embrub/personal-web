        <h4>characters featured: archer, esme</h4>
        <p>i keep associating songs from this album with these two characters. in the <a href="../may/heart4brains.html">last batch</a> it was 'heart for brains' and now it's this. 
        i think it's pretty obvious that i didn't try too hard w this art, just a quick doodle to get the energy out. so are these next few.</p>
