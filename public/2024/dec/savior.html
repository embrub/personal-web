        <p>yes both charas in the <i>1st image</i> are isra</p>
        <p>aghh i wanted to do messy crosshatching, i feel like i used to do that good. but unlike my 2021 self i do NAWT have the 
            patience, which unfortunately is the ONE thing u need if u wanna do good crosshatching. okayy scratch that, the SECOND 
            illust here is good cross-hatching, the first is ass and balls because it was a tougher scene to draw i'm ngl. 
            ack.... this sequence of illusts is mildly embarrassing to me as well, as with all lore-related drawings here, i don't think 
            i'll ever shake that sense of shame. whatever, 
        </p>
        <p>art-wise i love the 2nd one but the 1st one peeves me a LOT. at the time i was somewhat proud of it, but now it looks a little
            odd to me. feel like i would have liked both the visuals and the process more if i'd just. painted normally. i think
            this subject matter woulda looked rly good as a painting too. i don't want to revisit it though, it was hard enough to 
            draw the first time LOL 
        </p>

        <p>here's an alt color scheme for the 1st one.</p>
