        <p>it's always the doodles i spend 30 minutes on that end up being my favorites over the illusts that took
            30+ hrs huh. anyways im obsessed with this one, it's mildly ooc but they are both so gorgeous to me OK.
            for inspo, enzo's fit is inspired by tops from hidolatral-theodol &lt;3333, otis's was freehanded.</p>
        <!-- <p>real talk, can i go on a side-tangent for a second? i cannot stand pinterest and how nobody on that website credits the damn source. 
            even worse for ref photos where they don't mention the name of the model or the photographer.. like how am i supposed to find more of what i'm looking for if you don't mention the brand? man fuck off. i rly don't want to use pinterest, i rly don't, but photo access is limited unless you make an account urkkk</p> -->
        <p>i made the <a href="../../ocs/images/heightchart.jpg">height chart</a> for the oc page after i made this art,
            so looking back on this one is funny. if otis is still in heels then zo is standing on a box to reach his height lol</p>
