                <h3>month end thoughts:</h3>
                <p>i liked orange these few months. hmm, i feel like i could have drawn more, but it was one of those "too many ideas
                    not enough energy" type of times. a few arts look forced(?) bc they kinda wereeeeeeeee... i draw to stress relieve 
                    and i don't think about it too hard, but these few months taught me that sometimes i SHOULD save that energy:  
                    i absolutely should NAWT draw if i dont feel like it, even if i reaaally like an illust concept.
                    nowadays i oscillate a lot between "i need to make something right now or i'll die" and "ouuuuuuu i don't want
                    to....." it's tough to balance esp when it extends to outside obligations too.......... h heeelppp</p>
                <p>story project developments: i've been obsessed with centuriae (formerly AM S2) lately because i've now 100% severed it from its source! it's now
                    a sister-story set in the same universe as S1 instead of its direct sequel and i couldn't be happier. no one knows wtf AM S1 is because i don't draw/talk abt it here, but
                    they're among some of my oldest OCs that callisto, isra, and marcene no longer fit into. separating them officially is like. a huge step
                    and i'm really giddy about it. this should have happened sooner but i'd just been so sentimental for old ideas that i've been holding myself back while trying to keep it tied to this old overarching story. and 
                    now w/o those restraints i can REALLLYYYYYYY get into the tone i want. 
                </p>
                <p>elsewhere, my brain has been preoccupied with fandom as of late. i've gotten into P:EG again, in addition to mainline DR after
                    having a contrarian phase. i've been watching a lot of vodkaSunnyD vods lately and realizing this style of
                    commentary is reaaally what i've been craving. im so very used to following commentators who have a very critical
                    lens, and it makes it rather difficult to enjoy the game they're playing, but vodka leans into the camp while still
                    being earnest i think. rly refreshing rediscovering all things DR again. other than P:EG i've been digging my teeth
                    into evboverse and the realm SMP</p>
                <p>anyhow, ouuuuuuuu my energy iss spenttt,,,,....... few drawings in this batch as of 2/28 seem "finished" to me, but i have some good
                    ideas i wanna execute eventually. we keep it chugging. hope yuo are well as well.
                </p>
