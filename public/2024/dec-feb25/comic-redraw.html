        <p>an extended redraw of <a href="../../2023/apr-may/you-again.html">this old post</a> from april 23'</p>
        <p>this was the original sketch/thumbnail, not shown in the linked post</p>
        <a href="images/randomcomic.PNG"><img src="images/randomcomic.PNG" alt=""></a>
        <p>ouuugh this is such a 2023 page layout. it makes me feel really weird.</p>
        <p>this is not a canon interaction btw, the original was made just for practice.</p>
        <p>my artstyle from the previous april artworks weren't even bad, it was just THIS one that was scuffed and NEEDED a redo.
            the webtoon scroll influence on the redraw is STRONG. i think it flows better, but kinda just forces the reader
            to zoommm thru the text bubbles. everything else feels way better tho. i really like looking at this one agh.........</p>
