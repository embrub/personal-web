        <p>this was meant to be a small doodle and then it got out-of-hand. i reaaaally like the lineart on this one
            but it almost didin't happen. i blocked out the colors first and then halfway through was
            like "wait this would look OK with an outline" and then lasso-tooled lineart on top of all of my flats. i
            had
            separated all of the individual clothing and hair elements into different layers intending to do some cool
            collage-y shit and then i didn't even need it in the end &#128557;&#128557;
        </p>
        <p>the fact that this started as a throwaway doodle is very poignant in this one,
            i don't draw side-profiles like this and i don't draw bodies like this. i don't know if you can spot
            the difference but to me it's very evident. the style of this illust is cute ig but it's somewhat ooc for
            me.
        </p>
        <p>anyhow, now for some less impulsive doodles</p>
        <a href="images/adoration1.jpg"><img src="images/adoration1.jpg" alt="digital artwork. a pensive, younger isra props up the severed head of a younger callisto in his palms. the head smiles sickly. it is adorned with a gold-wreath-crown and its blood seeps through the gaps in isra's palms. the scene is dimly lit and intimate."></a>

        <a href="images/bbgs.PNG"><img src="images/bbgs.PNG" alt="colorful digital artwork with a poster-like composition. at its center, callisto and isra pose next to each other. isra stands mischievously with his hands folded together, and a disgruntled callisto side-eyes him."></a>

        <a href="images/four1.PNG"><img src="images/four1.PNG" alt="four different portraits of callisto at different points of his life - once dressed in his gladiator uniform, unkept, enraged - once in formal attire, smiling and eager - once fractured in bright orange, a slash to his neck - then in the current day, dressed in a cape jacket and scarf, sword slung over his back, temperamental and avoidant eyes."></a>
