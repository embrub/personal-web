        <p>very vague centuriae lore that myself and only myself can understand. he was never actually naked in this scene, 
            it's moreso something something uhh rebirth something...</p>
        <p>the first image is a repainting of an earlier iteration of the same artwork from feb-march that i hated SO much. 
            the original did not match my expectations and was just....... so PLAIN and FLAT, and after uploading it to the site, i was 
            overcome with suuch a visceral sense of shaaame: this scene is so important, i CANNOT fumble its only depiction on this site so far. 
            the original is one of the few arts on this site that i cannot stand to look at, and yet i 
            i can't delete it bc i wanna honor the site mission statement......ack...... and so, to remedy this, i spent the entire month of april 
            on-and-off re-painting it. and i'm DONE now.</p>
        <p>i adore the colors in this newer version - it's certainly more consistent, mystifying, yet simultaneously..... more palatable? 
            the latter of which i'm unsure is a thing i want for it. i'll admit i wasn't able to re-capture some of the visceral emotion 
            present in the original: the one thing that bums me out. (i redrew the faces so many times until i gave up and left 
            them as is.) i can give the OG that amount of credit, it's weird and uncanny. even w all that though, i still DO like the 
            repainting way better. much more prouder of this one. marcene stays as she is though. hi mama.

            <p>aghh i wanted to do messy crosshatching, i feel like i used to do that good. but unlike my 2021 self i do NAWT have the 
                patience, which unfortunately is the ONE thing u need if u wanna do good crosshatching. okayy scratch that, the SECOND 
                illust here is good cross-hatching, the first is ass and balls because it was a tougher scene to draw i'm ngl. 
                ack.... this sequence of illusts is mildly embarrassing to me as well. i get like that whenever i try to share lore. 
                OH WELL.......
            </p>
            <p>art-wise i love the 2nd one but the 1st one peeves me a LOT. at the time i was somewhat proud of it, but now it looks a little
                odd to me. feel like i would have liked both the visuals and the process more if i'd just. painted normally. i think
                this subject matter woulda looked rly good as a painting too. i don't want to revisit it though, it was hard enough to 
                draw the first time LOL
