        <h4>characters featured: esme, enzo, otis</h4>

        <p>i've hit a bit of a roadblock in ptc's plot writing recently and it's made my desire for big story-related arts plummet. pantser woes, i'm surprised it didnt happen sooner. i think i need to take a long pause from thinking about ptc seriously lol. anyhow, here r some more unserious lighthearted doodles :3 </p>

        <!-- <h4>characters featured: juro, esme, lyre</h4>
        <a href="images/thirdwheel.PNG"><img src="images/thirdwheel.PNG" class="horiz" alt="a comic page done in a lasso-tooled, simplistic style. juro walks up to esme asking for help but before she can finish, a peeved esme cuts her off, bluntly saying, 'break up with her.' in the next panel, lyre walks up to esme asking for help, but esme once again cuts her off with a 'break up with him.'"></a>
        <p>imagine being a third wheel in both of ur friend groups and both of those relationships r messy as hell couldnt be me</p>
