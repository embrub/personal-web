            <p>i talked about PM or 'plastic mind' a little in <a href="../../2023/oct-dec/mech-boys.html">this post</a>, but
            because of a rp i did with a friend a while back, i've really taken a liking to these characters once again after
            years(?) of not touching them.</p>
        <p>ouuuuu i became lowkey obsessed and it KILLED ME, during my finals week i was thinking of so many drawing
            ideas but did not have the luxury to draw ANY OF THEM. these arts were just very veryyy quick scribbles 
            to scratch the itch, but i have yet to make a serious illustration with them.</p>
            <hr>
        <p>a little introduction to these characters: </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>keyata</strong> - the girl in the 1st and 2nd drawing - is a painter who'd recently lost her eyesight.</li> 
            <li><strong>ali</strong> - bottom 2 drawings - is a failed prototype/robot caretaker, made in the image of 
                a deceased inventor.
            </li>
