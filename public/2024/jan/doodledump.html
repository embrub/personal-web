        <a href="images/zo-polite1.png"><img src="images/zo-polite1.png" alt="digital art of enzo in a simplified, cutsey style. his hands are clasped together and he stares at the camera, eyebrows raised and small smile on his face. captioned, 'polite.' the artwork has a warm orange-brown overlay and is textured with gritty vertical lines."></a>
        <br>
        <a href="images/zo-polite2.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-polite2.jpeg" alt=""></a>

        <p>you know who it is. </p>
        <a href="images/zo-lol.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-lol.jpeg" alt="two doodles, to the left is enzo without his signature 'halo ahoge,' captioned, 'who?' - to the right is enzo with it, captioned 'oh, it's enzo.'"></a>
        <p>i drew these at various points in between winter break's end and spring break's beginning. 
            the first drawing was a doodle from my class notes that i colored digitally, and the one below i
            drew immediatley after finishing my last exam. fitting visual.</p>
        <a href="images/zo-snooze.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-snooze.jpeg" alt="scratchy and sketchy digital artwork of enzo asleep at a desk. "></a>
        <br>
        <a href="images/zo-sketch.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-sketch.jpeg" alt="digital artwork of enzo staring sharply at the camera. he's shrouded in darkness, except for a dull spotlight shining on him from overhead. the backdrop is an eyestraining cyan."></a>
        <p>heres one of trinity.</p>
        <a href="images/trinityy.jpeg"><img src="images/trinityy.jpeg" alt="a pastel-colored digital illustration of trinity looking tentatively to the side with a weak smile. the lineart is scratchy and free-form and the colors spill from the lines, making the art look inky, blotchy, and hazy."></a>
        <p>and..... an alt design for somebody.</p>
        <a href="images/gio-godish-dood.png"><img src="images/gio-godish-dood.png" alt="a scribbly, rough digital art of a celestial-looking girl. her skin is a grayish purple and bright starry freckles line her cheeks. her sleeveless dress is a deep violet and a single tear-shaped gem is placed above her chest. glowing horns adorn the sides of her head and curl upwards, while two dripping halos hover above her."></a>
        <br>
        <p>overall i don't have much to say about these. they were stress relievers in between schoolwork and so are rly
            sloppy and not too visually *there* &#129335;
        </p>
        <p>gahhh these past few months in particular have been p slow for <i>polished</i> artworks, i feel kinda sad abt it,, 
            the consistency in which motivation hits will continue to be scattered ig. mostly, i feel insane.
