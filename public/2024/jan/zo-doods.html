            <p>you know. i went through the stages of grief drawing this, i made a banger sketch, [i MEAN it when 
                i say the sketch was better than the lineart. speaking of which.] i hated the lineart,
                seethed about it, fixed it, then accepted it. you can still see the fruits of my peril in the 
                second page lol.</p>
