        <p>i put significantly more effort into these ones as opposed to the others lol. i barely have any <i>presentable</i> rendered artwork of archer and lyre despite them being the protags of ptc's entire second arc, smh. i really do like them as characters, it's time i give them a lil more love &#128564;</p>
