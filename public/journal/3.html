                        <p>just finished watching a complete playthrough of "lies of p" and i am in shambles</p>
                        <p>i havent done fanart in years but i might relapse, just for this game. like.
                            leave it up to me to fall for yet another story about an inhuman MC who grapples with
                            their humanity,, clearly i have a set of themes and aesthetics i am biased for</p>

                                art-ing</h3>
                        <p>hm..... it kinda sucks how i get the most inspiration for my hobbywork when i have work
                            outside of it to do. when i have peace, i can't draw. i gotta be stressed out of my mindddd
                            and deranged and depressed as hell, and then suddenly the ideas start flowing. i don't know
                            when art shifted from just being a fun exercise in communication/storytelling to solely 
                            being a method for projection and stress relief.
                        </p>
                        <p>nowadays, i find that the more i like a character, the more it means that i can see myself
                            and my emotions thru them. like, i am a SUCKER for OCs with copious amounts of dread and
                            guilt and existential horror attached with them. </p>
                        <p>i once saw a post on twitter
                            that was someone saying smthn like... "i'm creating more characters with my own flaws in
                            them,
                            idk how to feel abt it"... and the other guy says, "oh, that means you're learning to love
                            yourself." something like that. and that thought alone, no matter how backwards, has carried
                            me thru a lotta the "ick" that i used to feel about using my stories as a vent space. having
                            a hole inside ur head and putting the same one into a character is fine. point being it lets
                            u examine that hole, at least for me. i've been doing it since TFPOEL and still do it now
                            with PTC.</p>
                        <p>but it's still abit weird to me when i try thinking abt it. there's such a huuuuuge
                            difference between why i draw now and why i used to draw when i was younger, but it became the most clear to me while i was trying to rewrite AM S1 during
                            the summer and realized i couldn't replicate the old draft's charm. if its all so
                            different, what makes me wanna stick around and keep doing it?
                            a part of me still wants to go back and tap into that older, clearer more "pure" creation mindset, but a
                            part of me also knows that i don't necessarily need it anymore.

                        <p>i say i "think" because i cannot remember a THING that happened LOLOLOL. and now that it's
                            over, i think that having a clear mind <b>sucks.</b></p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>i mentioned in a <a href="#af-theme">previous entry</a> that i wanted to gamble a lil and
                            join team werewolf, but i ended up picking vampire in the end. i slightly regretted it
                            when the event actually started and i realized literally 70% of my bookmarks are
                            on my team,,, so i'd just invertedly signed myself up for ONLY doing friendly-fires thru
                            the month NAURR ;o;
                        </p>
                        <p>i was so close to switching teams but then i settled down when i realized
                            team vamp was actually losing and i was a part of the underdogs now. instant team
                            loyalty.
                            still kinda pissed abt the friendly-fires thing tho. i've been thoroughly nerfed.</p>

                        <p>idk why, but it's so much easier for me to fall into burnout now guhhh. i got projects i
                            still wanna work on, but starting them seems like more of a chore now ;o;
                        </p>
                        <p>this site being kinda a huge example, like i wanna make some shrines and maybe another
                            page to showcase some OC playlists. a lotta work thou....... think i just need to find
                            more medias to become obsessed with again

                                2023 themes</h3>
                        <p>oh wow o WOW this year's theme reveal came as such a surprise to me</p>
                        <p>with such powerhouses of potential prompts like "order vs chaos" and "creation vs
                            destruction" i did not expect that "vampires vs werewolves" would be the final pick. ngl
                            out
                            of all of em tho, vamps vs werewolves has the most mascot potential and also aligns pretty
                            well with previous themes... so i see why it was chosen but like.... personally i was
                            rooting for "time vs space" myself &lt;--- she is full of OC-themed biases
                        </p>
                        <p>team picks this year are gonna be HARD though... previously my personal preferences
                            would align exactly with one side, but this year i am SO very unsure. "vampire" is
                            calling
                            to me but i have a feeling numbers are gonna be incredibly skewed this year. EVERYONE's
                            gonna pick team vampire mannnnn, "wither vs bloom" last year was so engaging imo cuz
                            the numbers were so close but i have a feeling my werewolf folks might be the
                            underdogs.......... which makes my gambling instincts tingle.
                        </p>

                        <hr>

                        <h3 id="layout"><span class="highlight-2">&thinsp;6-23-23&thinsp; | new layout</h3>
                        <p>ok so i made a new layout for the site? i really dunno how i feel about this one guhh.
                            old
                            layout had this minimalist, metalic-like color scheme
                            and while i didn't like it much at first, i'd gotten used to it by the time i whipped
                            up this new softer, notebook-like look ;o;</p>

                        <p>old style:</p>
                        <a href="images/screenshot.png">
                            <img src="images/screenshot.png" class="journal">
                        </a>
                        <p>the new vers def has its charm & def more cohesion,,,,, but im going thru some kinda
                            stockholm syndrome rn lol. i wanna try and incorporate the darker gray colors into this
                            new theme's colors somehow, i tried it a lil but i just. could not. get it to look
                            right. rip.
                        </p>
                        <p>oh well i guess that comes with running a website- constant changes & updates & fusses, i
                            know i'll probs never be satisfied eheh. this new theme needs some work tho too-- i see
                            so
                            many mfs on neocities with the most cluttered and colorful websites with blinkers and
                            weird
                            shiny things that i dont even know how they put in there. & that's soso inspiring,,, i
                            wanna
                            clutter my site too but i gotta PLAN for it bc ik i'll probably most likely trip over
                            myself
                            if not lol. mostly i wanna add more oranges and reds and browns guhhh.
                        </p>

                        <p>there is no album that speaks to me more than void fantasy, some of the lyrics and atmosphere in 
                            these are so resonant to me even tho i know i don't have the same experiences, 
                            it finds a way to click *somewhere.* reaching "dream of escape" is like a punch to the gut 
                            man. although i def like rook's newer works more, this one just hits REALLY different ykwim.
