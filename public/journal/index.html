                <p>releasing art in tri/quarterly monthly batches is kind of a detriment sometimes bc i recently re-read my commentary for
                    dec-march 2025 and it's all so very all-over-the-place. i said i didn't draw much but the batch was chock-full, 
                    i said a lot of artwork was
                    "unfinished" but in another page i say i'm happy with how things look... opinions can change rapidly over a few
                    months and things i wrote in february can be outdated by the time march rolls around and yet i don't have patience for 
                    monthly drops. i reaally do hope that my writing is easy to follow</p>

                        &thinsp;</span></h3>
                <p>i know twitter has always been bad but has it just gotten immeasurably worse since march for anyone
                    else??? like no matter the circles i engaged with in the past, i would always be recommended 
                    content on the FYP equivalent to what i ALREADY engaged with - but as of late, the algorithm has been jack shit: 
                    random movie clips, fight clips, the same skits and stunts reposted by gimmicks accounts over and over, and edtwt?????????? huh???????????????? since when have i EVER
                    engaged with that side of twitter?????????????? obviously i've experienced this before but it's never been THIS bad- i've never had the algorithm pivot so strongly to
                    favor rage bait, it's so frustrating. i have only ever joined twitter to follow and get updates on my favorite artists and indie projects
                    and it's only 30% of what i find on my tl now.</p>
                    <p>it's even worse because you USED to be able to see whether you were
                    recommended certain
                    content because a mutual liked it... but then a certain someone removed that feature, so now i
                    genuinely can't tell if the algorithm is fucked up or if someone i follow/someone who follows me is fucked up.
                    clicking "not interested in this post" doesn't even do anything. i've had to block so many accounts
                    ON SIGHT as of late and i've NEVERRR had to go on block-sprees in all my years on twt up until this month,
                    neverrrrrr. not that blocking is particularly strong or useful anymore. alright so... isn't the point of 
                    blocking to create a safety barrier between you and the undesired person? then tell me who thought it 
                    was a good idea for accounts i blocked to still be able to message me? who thought it was a good idea for 
                    accounts i blocked to still be able to view what i post? what is the point of blocking someone if they 
                    can still get to you????? what>?????
                </p>
                <p>urkkkk and the weird ads too -- you used to be able to block accounts and they never show up
                    again, but it seems like there is no end to the same genre of MAGA bootlickers showing up against my
                    will in paid ad spaces and i can't even do anything about it. like, okayyy whatever, social platforms can have
                    their political biases, but i should AT THE VERY LEAST be able to customize my experience. this is not 
                    something i should have to pay money to get rid of. if we wanna swing the other way, bluesky is 
                    wildly liberal and i can still click "not interested" and it ACTUALLY WORKS. i ACTUALLY don't see it 
                    anymore. maybe another website CAN TAKE SOME NOTES.

                <p>^ those are the top replies in a single tweet btw. genuinely unusable platform.</p>
                <p>it reaaaally sucks. i would have quit entirely were it not for that 30% of artwork and projects
                    updates on my tl that i still stick around for. sucks that after the initial bluesky migration, very few
                    people actually stuck to it and kept using it. most ppl i know gave up and went back to twitter
                    since it is still the larger social platform and their work would reach more people there. people
                    are OBLIGATED to stay not even because of the quality of the app but because of its associated reach. 
                    which sucks ass. it's the reason i still stick around despite all of the above. i have 
                    highkey been contemplating it though but if i go thru with it it's goodbye to all of my art inspos aughhhh
                    is it worth it man is it even worth it is it even

                <p>the oldest view isn't scary to me but it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. i remember near the end
                    of highschool all my favorite childhood hangout spots closing down, and the mall being the last one to go. by chance, i
                    stopped by a month-ish before its closing and seeing it virtually empty was such a unique sinking feeling. i based my AP
                    art portfolio based off similar feelings at the time. "life of a giant" produced such a reassuring feeling ackkk,,

                        <img src="images/eva.png">
                        <p>i cant believe i typed paragraphs upon paragraphs analyzing this
                            character and explaining why she would not kill anyone, only for her to kill somebody in the
                            first fucking chapter i cannot believe it. auuughhhh my shayla............. i fucking miss
                            wolfgang too. i cannot believe this is the outcome. im clutching wenona tightly to me rn.
                            nothing better happen to her next chapter istg. ISTG.... im so sad guys im so sadd.</p>
                        <p>i really do love her character writing, it's rare i see such a complex and fleshed out first
                            culprit in these kinds
                            of games, and especially rare to see such an extensive exploration of how bullying and
                            isolation can cause dysfunctionally.
                            so often we see a perfect victim in fiction and yet eva is so nuanced.
                            even though she is clearly a capable person who is arrogant in her abilities, she's not
                            confident in her
                            self-actualization. her previous experiences with social isolation and bullying had
                            implanted in her self-sabotaging habits and both a searing superiority complex AND victim
                            complex,
                            one where she deserves sooo much yet cannot possibly grow because something is always in the
                            way. where no matter
                            if someone is nice to her, she comes up with a reason why they really aren't. she tries to
                            be intimidating, she lies and isolates
                            herself, and then chastises the others when they're mean to her after the "mathlete" reveal,
                            when in reality, the shock
                            of the lie is what caused their distrust, not her talent itself. nobody would have given a
                            fuck if she'd just been genuine from the
                            start AND YET SHE DOESN'T REALIZE THIS. she does all of these mental gymnastics and
                            self-sabotaging
                            because she EXPECTS hatred as a DEFAULT- she doesn't give herself a chance to even
                            <strong>TRY</strong>.
                            it was only FOUR DAYS into the killing game yet it was already far too much for her. it's
                            easier for her to
                            antagonize herself, to kill, because she EXPECTS no way out. the tragedy of her death is
                            that she did it to herself.
                            it's sad that her life wasn't easy, it's sad that she never got a chance to grow, it's sad
                            that the others were
                            at fault for antagonizing her, and it's sad that she is also at fault for how she ended up
                            as a culprit.

                    <div>
                        <p>crazy happenings in this viewing experience: i got wrongly spoiled TWICE. i accidentally
                            scrolled down into the comments section of the daily life video and in the corner of my
                            vision, i saw a comment tht said: "it makes sense that W<i>[...]</i> was the first one to
                            die" and i only saw the letter "W" and was SO SO pissed off because i thought i'd been
                            spoiled and that WENONA was gonna die. in my rage i forgot that wolfgang existed. so when
                            the body reveal cinematic happened, i was SO SHOCKED. FLABBERGASTED OUT OF MY MIND THAT IT
                            WAS WOLFGANG FUCKING AKIRE. i had to scream and pace around my room, i cant describe the raw 
                            emotion i felt in that moment. considering his behavior in the prologue, i expected him
                            to die the LEAST out of all the cast. top 10 fangan moments. im still so so giddy over this
                            twist.</p>
                        <p>AND THEN- YEAH? AND THEN? i was scrolling on twitter and saw an unspoilered video of
                            diana's speech"- AND I THOUGHT THAT DIANA KILLED WOLFGANG AND THAT SPEECH WAS HER
                            CONFESSION. but NO. when she was built up as a red herring during the trial, i thought
                            it was already over- that's it- she killed him. AND THEN IT CONTINUED FOR ANOTHER 4 HOURS.
                            AND EVA WAS THE REAL KILLER. WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKK.......... THE MOST INSANE WHIPLASH OF
                            EMOTIONS DURING A SINGLE FANGAN CHAPTER I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. I WISH I'D LIVE-BLOGGED IT.

                        <p>it's really interesting how vastly my
                            opinions on wolfgang flipped from ch0 to ch1 lol. i thought he was rly charming and
                            interesting up until he crashed out at the mock trial and then suddenly i lost all interest.
                            this line of thinking continued until he died in ch1 and the shock of his death suddenly
                            made me love him again. and
                            then when the flashback happened and we saw him disheveled stumbling and sobbing he shot up
                            like 3 ranks higher in the
                            tier list LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

                        <p>jokes aside, i unironically adore his character. a hook has been cast. even though his
                            backstory has already been
                            implied thru his FTEs and envelope, i feel like there is still much complexity to him that
                            hasn't yet been revealed.
                            i think he's a fascinating character. his inclination to be morally correct in order to
                            chase the legacy of his
                            mother, despite having (what i think is) the temper of his father? UGH IT'S PEAK. i feel so
                            very sad for him. the
                            way both him, eva, AND damon all share the same complicated struggle of diluted self-image
                            and the need to prove
                            themselves. somebody hold me back im about to CRASH OUT. the three of them deserved to live
                            and work out their
                            differences and all be buddies man IM GONNA CRASH OUT.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>i think damon is SUCH a refreshing MC, how despite the subversion of having an "asshole MC"
                            that he isn't edgy
                            or one-note at all.</p>
                        <p>his identity is directly intertwined with being a debater- it's his ace and his defining
                            quality which he
                            wants others to see him for soooo BAD. he's spent so long trying to prove himself that when
                            he encounters those with
                            non-academic talents, it makes sense he'd be dismissive and rude, which, bummer. but when
                            someone DOES come along with
                            accolades that align with his standards he is SOOO fucking intimated LOLLL. he clearly is
                            capable of respect and
                            admiration yet his ego often gets in the way. he thinks he's being cool and stoic and
                            confident and yet EVERYBODY CLOCKS
                            HIM as NOT that, IT'S SO FUNNY. toshiko gives him a cute nickname, ingrid babies him,
                            cassidy pokes fun at him, kai looks to him for safety. HE'S SUCH A DORK LOLL. i think he's
                            very interesting and i enjoy the dichotomy he brings, where despite his rudeness, it never
                            comes across as "too much"
                            imo. i actually find it really easy to root for him</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>it's very easy to say that killing off wolfgang and eva is "wasted potential" - for like a
                            week after my watchthrough
                            i thought the exact same thing. i watched thru both the prologue and ch1 again recently
                            though and it kinda made me
                            realize that a lottt of that perceived potential was me trying to see FAR too much into the
                            future. i was aware of the
                            meta - of the DR format and i EXPECTED wolfgang and eva to be the designated rival and ally.
                            it felt like all the
                            conflict that was built up for 2 chapters, establishing cornerstones of conflicts thought to
                            be overarching, had just
                            been discarded and slammed closed in my face. now tho, i think that this feeling is nowhere
                            the fault of the
                            writing or narrative setup - it's simply cuz the i knew the DR format. while it makes sense
                            to be disappointed by the outcome, these twists it weren't as
                            cruel and door-slam-y as i initially perceived. and the longer i think about it, the more it
                            makes me unbearably curious what the crew will do for ch2.
                            i'll admit i don't like the idea of diana as an antagonist to damon, and i hope that she'll
                            grow on me more. it's too simple
                            really, but i know not to underestimate the writers so i'll hold the rest of my thoughts.
                        </p>
                        <p>OK. narrative decisions aside... who are my OTHER favorite characters because my OG favorites
                            just fucking killed each other?
                            i think right now, it goes: (1) damon, (2) ulysses, (2) wenona</p>
                        <p>ooughhhhhh i reaaaaaally like ulysses. despite him being one of the more gimmick-y characters
                            imo, i think all of his little
                            oddities combined makes him a very endearing yet fascinating character. like. goodness
                            gracious i love this insomniac
                            conspiratorial chronically ill forgetful history nerd. i truly wish his FTEs were more
                            interesting, it was only until the final 2 that we finally got
                            something opinionated - i want to know more about his fear of death and his conspiracies
                            about the world nearing collapse. as
                            a historian, surly he is hyper-aware of old patterns reeling their heads - how does this
                            play into how he uses his ultimate?
                            how desperately he stays diligent in his work at the cost of his health? ughhhhhhhhh i
                            initially didn't like him all that much but ch1 made me grow on him sooo
                            much.
                        </p>
                        <p>as for wenona, i have always loved confident, wry, self-assured women characters. there is
                            something about the businesswoman
                            archetype as well that just gets me so giddy. i loved reading through wenona's FTEs, she has
                            such an interesting and
                            engaging life and listening to her walk thru her past decisions and how she views her clan
                            is so curious. especially
                            considering her imitation/echo arts, i wonder if she betrayed them in some way? it's VERY
                            likely that she's a
                            much worse person than we've seen so far (also considering "unions" is one of her dislikes
                            LOL) and i cannot WAIT to
                            see what the team does with her and i. i actually can't take it man i want to see more of
                            her AUUUGHHH I WANNA KNOW MORE.
                            it's kILLING ME LET ME INNN LET ME INNN.
                        </p>
                        <p>additionally, given that wenona is sharing ulysses' spot as my current favorite (u cant make
                            me choose), i am naturally a
                            ulywen shipper ahaha~ *GETS SHOT* *GETS SHOT* *GETS SHOT* *GETS SHOT* *GETS SHOT*</p>

                    you've come. but oh BOY oh BOYYY is it hard to live by those words. a completely harmless story from
                    2022 has been haunting me since i've posted it and i RESIST the EVIL URGE to delete it off both the
                    internet and my hard drive at all times. i used to lament about why some artists release their work
                    and then never interact with it again or even resist engagement in its discussion like they never
                    wanna see it again. OK WELL I GET IT NOW. HAVE MERCYYYY.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>at the start, i felt very "meh" about it, and that feeling persisted all thru the trial UNTIL
                            the
                            final 2 episodes. then it all clicked and i felt like all of that buildup was WORTH IT. I
                            GET IT
                            NOWW. that was the best ending to a trial i've ever seen for a fangan - the only other one
                            that
                            is even comparable to this feeling of utter horror i felt is the ending to SDRA2 ch.5......
                            i
                            know there was a lot of divisive discussion about who would've been the better blackened for
                            trial 2 among the final 2 contenders, but the way this trial concluded has me convinced this
                            is
                            how it had to be. i loved this outcome and felt the execution was both fitting and
                            surprisingly
                            respectful. like. way to address a character's core flaw and challenge it so intensely. i
                            still
                            don't understand or like <span class="spoiler">david</span> though. shocker. i felt a little
                            confused when he suddenly became a fan-favorite after his mask slipped this chapter. he
                            still
                            has a lot to answer for, and the fact that a lot of viewers started hearing him out cuz
                            <span class="spoiler">he pulled this "i suddenly care about xander now" thing is.... i don't
                                know.
                                i'm aware he knows what teruko's REAL secret is and that's partly why he started to
                                defend
                                xander: cuz he <i>knows</i> something now..</span> but i still can't find myself liking
                            him
                            or being interested in him, after all of his escalations and manipulations i think he's just
                            over-the-top. idk idk i might just need to rewatch ch.2 again.
                        </p>

                            probably pulled their inspo from in their real life and it is just awfully relatable 
                            and dreadful. the story is packed with such gravity, makes you feel such anger and 
                            leaves you endlessly dissatisfied and empty. the amnesiac scene. fucking hell. tldr;

                        <p>everything's better on the second run. my favorite thing about this game is how complex and
                            layered all of the characters feel, despite the relatively short runtime and the jittery
                            non-linear storytelling, i felt like i'd known them for much longer. all of my feelings boil
                            down to "holy shit i feel awful for everyone involved." except that one guy ofc. i didn't
                            necessarily feel horror or fear, just an overarching feeling of disbelief that kept getting

                    <div>
                        <p>i want to write a much longer dissection and analysis of this mod because WOW. it has been so
                            long since i've become THIS fixated on a story before. i wasn't aware that the mod would
                            "get
                            darker" - i just went into it thinking it was a comedy mod and was THRILLED and completely
                            captivated when it began its heel turn. i know some people were turned off by it, but i
                            thought
                            the shift in tone enhanced what came before it and marked an iconic sort of uniqueness away
                            from
                            any other mod. i don't think it was as dark as others have described: there is, i think,
                            fitting
                            amounts of consequence and fitting amounts hope granted to the main 3.</p>
                        <p>i do think that a lot of the worldbuilding could have been condensed. the gift, the mothers,
                            manos, the wishes-- it is so very difficult to understand on 1st playthrough. while it does
                            give
                            replays a lot more value, there is the extra dilemma of the lore documents saying things
                            that
                            are so out of nowhere and destructive to the dark world we thought we knew... that i really
                            fail
                            to understand why they were included. i 100% get there is a bigger picture and also a
                            hyper-specific vision that the author has. i can try to grasp it as much as i want but i
                            don't
                            think i'll ever be able to get all of it. ig the mystery is the fun of it, but tbh i find
                            more
                            fun and value out of creating my own headcanons rather than trying to decipher existing
                            lore. that's not a completely bad thing btw. </p>
                        <p>because despite the deeper story being inaccessible imo, the fact that the author still managed
                            to create a world so vibrant and engaging, and characters you want to root for no matter what, and 
                            a world that even if not understandable, i STILL want to engage with on my own terms? that is
                            a VERY GOOD thing. it's rly hard for a complex story to not be boring, and this one certainly
                            isn't. there's a also lot of mixed opinions i have about the ambiguity of control for
                            everyone
                            effected by manos and what it even means. but i wanna save that for another time.</p>
                        <p>TLDR; i ADORE the story and characters, but at times anything deeper than surface level makes my head
                            spin LOL.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>the story is written in a way where both leads' words and actions are completely
                            understandable
                            and it's just kind of devastating to see anyways. there is just a looming atmosphere of
                            sinking, of quiet waiting that always leaves you on edge. the very scratchy and
                            texture-filled artwork helps with this immensely, man i fuckn adore the artwork.
                            one of the more interesting comics i've read in a while.</p>

                    <summary>parkour civilization - webseries (THIS ONE IS VERY LONG LOL. also i'm a seawatt apologist and BIASED AF)</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>okay you could argue with validity that i'm reading far too much into a nonsense minecraft
                            RP, but let it be known that i am an ex-DSMP fan and it will forever be ingrained in my
                            nature. i HAVE to. anyways.</p>
                        <p>i feel so bad for seawatt in season 2, he was the victim of a conflict between his leaders
                            that neither him and his people were ever going to survive. the system that he had trusted
                            left him with nothing, and in the end, he is the only one burdened with this knowledge as 
                            the endling of his realm. he sees everybody around him worshipping this status quo that he
                            alone knows is screwed and yet he falls in line and uses it to serve himself nonetheless. 
                            his new false power leaves him detached, living in luxury. he may as well have stayed like 
                            that forever... until one day, some naïve bozo comes along and finally has the nerve to change the status
                            quo... and does. but seawatt doesn't see evbo in a light of hope, instead, only a
                            tool to avenge what he'd lost- his one chance to finally overthrow this system which has
                            done him so wrong. so he tricks evbo, beginning the journey hating him, and in the end 
                            thinks of him fondly, but despite his efforts anyways, seawatt dies.
                            the user becomes the used, and as thanks for freeing him, the parkour villain kills him.
                            nothing had changed- he died as collateral to the problems of champions, the same as the rest
                            of the 5th layer all those years ago. and in the end, evbo will escape and defeat the
                            villain, save parkour civilization... but there is NO mention of the 5th layer in the ending
                            sequence at all - the 5th layer presumably remains hidden and it's unknown if seawatt's
                            people see any justice
                        </p>
                        <p>there is something to be said as well, as to how easily it is for the elites to rewrite
                            history on a whim. neither the parkour villain or the old man face
                            repercussions for what they've done - they simply get the peace of death. and it's arguable
                            the old man obviously
                            regretted sealing off the 5th layer/killing everyone, but it was such a drastic measure to
                            keep just ONE person away. if your control over a populous is so fickle that you have to
                            erase an entire civilization to keep its knowledge under your power, then you were not a
                            good leader to begin with. perhaps this is why the old man
                            falls into the void after giving evbo the key in the 1st movie, maybe its why he hides the
                            fact he's close to death when evbo becomes champion... he feels so much guilt that he
                            doesn't even want a place in parkour civilization- he knows he doesn't deserve it. yet
                            still, he keeps all of his actions a secret from the NEW champion who HE guided to power
                            until he was on his deathbed. evbo has to discover it all himself, and he in the process, hurts
                            evbo and the rest of parkciv by leaving him clueless and prime to be manipulated... 
                            which seawatt and the parkour villain take advantage of. if the old man hadn't been
                            a coward then maybe the parkour villain wouldn't have even been freed again, maybe even MORE
                            people wouldn't have needed to die for his mistakes.
                        </p>
                        <p>one thing i don't necessarily like abt season 2 is the fact much of the good guys' actions
                            were justified under the guise of "there was no other way" because the parkour villain was
                            simply an even bigger bad that needed to be contained.
                            it is still a very entertaining movie though and i did enjoy watching it. but imo season 1 is
                            an S-tier and season 2 is a B-tier. PVP civilization is on my watchlist.

                <p>you ever read a nsfw fanfiction so beautiful that it inspires you to write again?</p>
                <p>not write smut, i'm talking like regular sfw. anyways, that's happening with me rn. hi, i'm
                    getting back into writing prose again. thank you authors of ao3, i owe this
                    creative-writing rejuvenation to you. i don't even know what re-animator is.</p>
                <p>on a more serious note, i've been stuck in a bit of a writing slump for around a year or two now
                    and have recently and very suddenly leapt out of it.
                    the journal entry from 5-24-24's just REEEEKS of that old frustration.
                    dunno how long this motivation will last but for the first time
                    in a very long time i'm having fun with writing again. amazing what the palpable
                    love-of-the-game of another creator can do to a mf.
                </p>
                <p>i feel like how i was at 15 years old doing her first nanowrimo: <i>that</i> is the speed at
                    which
                    i am pouring my guts out into this google doc. unfortunately, some things never change and i
                    will never post 100% of what i am working on...
                    just know that i'm on that GRIND. the grind for a prequel oneshot for marcene, isra, and
                    callisto, abt how they all met and died and revived and allthat. i'll likely
                    put out some related artwork instead when i'm finished. yippe!</p>
