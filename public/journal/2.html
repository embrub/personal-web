                            creative writing and being perceived</span></h3>
                    <p>yknow, publicizing any form of writing, fiction or not, requires a certain amount of trust
                        with or
                        at least some kind of awareness of the audience right. once you make a writing public,
                        it's no longer YOURS - it's the people's. you can intend a certain messege however you want,
                        but what the audience interprets of that message is how it will be
                        percieved - not what you interpret of it. and that's a hurtle that i have not been able to
                        get over for a majority of my creative journey.</p>

                    <p>...which is kinda paradoxical to say, because i love <i>visual</i> artwork and i love
                        sharing it, so i should be able to share my writing too right? but there is just something
                        different in my mind between the medium of visual art, and the medium of prose, and that
                        difference is strong enough to
                        me that i'm completely turned off by the idea of sharing any of it to the public. i can't
                        explain it,
                        but i don't think i could ever showcase my stories/universes
                        in a way that feels <i>true</i>.
                        it used to tear me up inside, not being able to get tf over myself (lol) and just post
                        <i>something.</i> but nowadays i've
                        found contentment with fact that the deeper aspects of my work are only available to
                        like the TINIEST select friend group. cuz why do i even need to share all of my words, you
                        know??!?!? even if something's not that serious, if it's important to me, why should
                        i ever post it?

                    <p>i want to redo/repaint over <a href="../artblog/2023/aug-sept/light.html">this</a>
                        artwork eventually.</p>
                    <p>i took a peek at some WIP versions of this i had stowed away, and honestly. i think the
                        final piece is over-rendered.
                        in my illusts, i feel like there's more charm when i leave some parts messy,
                        and tbh i think some messiness would help to add more distinction between the two
                        figures here too. bc i do feel like they blend in too much here.</p>

                    <p>spare hearts from catghost ost just switched on in my playlist and i nearly jumped out of my
                        seat.
                        remembering bitterly that many of my stories are created on the backs of inspos that were
                        accumulated over multiple years from all corners of my life and no matter what, i will never not
                        be able see myself through my works, no matter how much i do not want to be reminded of certain
                        aspects associated from dead times.
                        not a vent, just mildly bittersweet reminiscing about an oc playlist which punches me in the
                        face every time i decide to revisit it blind</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>I DONT KNOW!! i dont know how i feel abt this one tbh. my main intent going into this was
                        to tidy up file paths, but to more importantly, clean up the mobile version of the site.
                        something that REALLLY bugged me abt the old layout was the fact that, since all of the
                        main content was inside of a scrollable div instead of all being contained in the
                        &lsaquo;main&rsaquo; tag, the search bar in mobile browsers wouldn't HIDE when you
                        scrolled down the page. and considering x & y overflow were hidden too, this caused a
                        lotta visual disparity for the main content block depending on the phone screen's size.
                        this new layout was my attempt to fix that.
                    </p>
                    <p>i'll have to figure out how it looks on other devices to be 100% sure, but im v sure this
                        issue has been solved now. a part of me really misses the smaller, more compact look
                        though. it's not all that different actually, but the old one was specifically more...
                        rounder imo. i'll probably tweak the layout some more later down the line to get that
                        vibe back, but we'll see.
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>i was rereading some older OC profiles, and i realized that...
                        the more i like a character of mine, the more pathetically i describe them
                        &#128557; ...and it's not in the endearing "aww poor thing &#60;/3" kinda
                        pathetic, i mean, descriptions that are so deprecating they legitimately give you
                        second-hand embarrassment.
                    </p>
                    <p>i think i do this out of a subconscious fear of not giving my faves enough flaws. like.
                        fear
                        of them being perceived as a mary sue or "creator's pet" .....but in my desire to hold
                        back
                        my favoritism, i just end up writing them so unfavorably instead.</p>
                    <p>hmm, its so tough when u have a fave. no matter how hard u try, u can't portray them how
                        u
                        do in ur head. its either pretentious writing or severe nerfing in my experience. when i
                        read older writings of mine, the aspects i deemed as my least favorites ended up being
                        the most well-written in the end, because i didn't take them too seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>its so hard not to take a character seriously tho when u already care so much.
                        how tf do ppl do it.... how to disconnect, my whole heart is in this bitch !!!
