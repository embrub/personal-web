                        <p>Living doll, historian, academic. Giomi is obsessively deciphering a series of runes that are
                            (supposedly) responsible for reviving the dead.</p>
                        <p>Always chipper and happy to teach, she will gladly geek out about her dead-end findings for
                            eons. Her dedication did not stem from <i>any</i> desire to save the dead, however. But
                            rather, from the fact she is missing all of her memories up until her discovery of these
                            runes.</p>
                        <p>A shady past, an eccentric passion, and a cutthroat desire for knowledge. Despite her
                            admirable profession, most tend to stay clear of her.</p>

                            heart - inexplicably he's still alive - and he's here for a reason. His existence, he
                            deemed, is proof that the universe has allowed him to resume his duty.</p>
                        <p>The war is over, but his job isn't, not until every other surviving enemy has been wiped off
                            the galaxy.</p>

                        <p>Naturally shy and soft-spoken, the type to choose her words carefully. Too timid to break
                            rules but too much of a thinker to stay still, Keyata wants a lot out of life and believes
                            she was meant for greater things. Upset with the hand she was dealt but more upset at
                            whether she's even *lived* up until this point.</p>

                            Last-minute, he was instead repurposed into a common caretaker bot.
                            The distressing experience led him to develop sentience.</p>
                        <p>He has a relaxed, yet stern attitude, and is unafraid to throw the occasional shade. Carries
                            with him an air of grandiosity, though it's obviously a bit to cover up his distaste for the
                            caretaker role. Believes he was meant for greater things.</p>

                <p>does a mother have a favorite child? does a creator have a favorite OC?
                    the answer is: yes, oh hell yes</p>

                        <h3>CALLISTO</h3>
                        <span class="tooltiptext big">
                            <p>centuriae's (or formerly AM's) breakout character for 7(?) years and counting. He is a character I’ve re-designed
                                and re-written over and over again as I’ve grown up, reflecting my own maturing and
                                fluctuating tastes. Feels like he’s aged with me, yet still somehow keeps the edgy
                                murder-hobo traits he inherited from his 1st draft when i created him at 13. A man, a
                                boy, a thing, filled with fear and anger and eldritch abominations. The ex-gladiator
                                menace who might just end the world someday. he is drawn very cutesy here (and all of the time tbh) 
                                cuz androgynous characters r very cathartic to me.

                        <span class="tooltiptext big">
                            <p>So. Y’know when you design a background character... but you just get way too attached and
                                then he sloooowly becomes one of the main guys? Yeah. Enzo was originally just a
                                background character for APU when that was still happening, and when I left the JSAB
                                fandom, he integrated into my main project at the time, DR:SE. in which he died. And
                                then i integrated him into in an OCT. in which he died. And now he’s in in PTC, in which
                                he- just kiddinggg! Or am I. Anyways I love this goober. He’s been revamped and changed
                                so many times just like Callisto, and each iteration seems to embody the same message 
                                just with a take slightly more evolved than the next. You know I love a character with a
                                copious amount of guilt and dread and existentialism attached to them.

                        <h3>ARCHER</h3>
                        <span class="tooltiptext big">
                            <p>When DR:SE ended, I often lamented about how I missed writing loud and un-subtle
                                characters because my newest project, PTC, was so much more slow and sad and
                                contemplative. Then, enter Archer. Blind death metaphor severed from the strings of life
                                and free to do whatever. But instead chooses to chase the past and kill an already dead
                                world by going after all those who escaped it. Holy shit. Fuck this guy. I missed this.
                                He is just so flexible of a character - he can be serious when he needs to be, but
                                mostly, he is a very jovial presence in the story, an extreme exaggeration of the
                                typical valiant hero. The world is dead and that is that, I will give everyone left
                                behind a quick, dignified end~~
