        <p>sometimes you create a character and then unparalleled obsession takes you by the throat. the inspo for
            creating the modern iteration of this character was:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>myself</li>
            <li>myself</li>
            <li>myself</li>
            <li>me</li>
            <li>myself</li>
        </ol>
        <p>and when you have yourself as a muse in this way, some fictional little guy becomes ur outlet for literally
            anything. it is so so freeing in a way i cannot describe. like! booyah let's turn all of THAT into a man in
            space, let's fucking go?????</p>

        <p>oh to be homesick for a place that has nothing left for you. oh to carry guilt and the obsessive need to
            redeem. oh to exist as a walking contradiction, a betrayal of self, a patchwork of causes you hate.
            compliancy for the sake of comfort never did you any good, and now look, you're the last one left. can you
            believe this is what you fought for?! he's. l.lll l. literally l. literally. l. literally me. li. guys.

        <img src="images/zo/fish.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""> <br>
        <p>i wish i could have made PTC earlier. making PTC & developing the water-based planet he comes from is what
            led led me to obtaining a genuine interest in fish, fishing, and marine life. i'm obsessed with the
            freshwater species in my local area and i want more than anything a pond in my backyard full of little guys.
            this new interest has brought me much joy and infatuation, something completely new which i never saw myself
            enjoying pre-PTC.</p>

        <h2>i like writing his moral dilemma</h2>
        <img src="images/zo/bbg.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""> <br>
        <p>all of this aside, enzo is not.... not that great of a guy morally. no matter how much he says he loves
            people or adjusts himself for others' comfort, all of his motives stem from a selfish desire to make
            <i>himself</i> feel safe. his quest to get back what he'd once lost and revive his dead world is done 
            not because he particularly cared for the world, but to satiate his own guilt. 
            </p>
            
        <p>his entire arc post-desertion revolves around whether he SHOULD try to revive a world which had intentionally 
            destroyed itself, who is culpable and should <i>he</i> be?
            his arc is about interpreting the past, finding peace with others and himself, to condemn history but not bury it, and to
            KNOW HIMSELF. to find something he GENUINELY wants to fight for instead of picking up whatever he needs to
            get by, because if that's not done he'll just end up repeating everything he'd just run from.</p>
        <p>for me, there is comfort in writing a conflicted character who still has to figure himself out in a world 
            which is a at a complete stop and is totally unchanging. One where the bad guys have won for a VERY long time. 
            The task to find self-determination after complete lack of identity and loss of familiarity is an incredibly compelling 
            one to me. and what is there to do but to approach it anyways. yummyyyyy.</p>

        <h2>my design philosophy which is just "fuck it we ball"</h2>
        <p>
            i draw enzo all of the time cuz he's so simple to draw. and hoo boy do i love drawing that stupid
            fucking gold-studded jacket, the shapes just come so easily to me. i love the rectangular language (sleeve
            cuffs, collar) and the sharpness which that ONE huge triangle (the lapels) adds. i love the neat ways i can
            pose him with his cape framing him, and how i can draw the extra fabric below his jacket swaying to indicate
            line of direction. all of this paired with the design trope of his pants blending into his shoes. auuughhhh. and 
            the pretentious fucking epaulettes. and his tired eyes and constant peeved expression. AUUUGHHH............ 
            i also adore the contrasting colors in his palette, the dark blues which make the bright yellows POP, how 
            striking his eyes are against the rest of his face, how weirdly regal his entire vibe is. helppp...
        </p>
        <p>OH and the stupid stupid little halo cowlick. i like to give that design quirk to characters who share a
            narrative of cheating death. perhaps too on-the-nose but I LIKE IT. it gives interesting SILHOUETTE and
            SILLY IRONY. speaking of his hair.... erm. long bangs to the eyes but short at the back?
            what. why does a soldier have that. but once again, if i think it looks neat then it will be finalized. he
            is just a little bit bishounen and that's part of his appeal now okayy</p>
        <p>everything combined creates this cohesive blend of so many tropes i can never get bored of looking at. on the 
            downside... all of it is incredibly inconvenient from a canonical fighting standpoint.... like when i retconed him to be a soldier in 2022, the uniform we know and love today was conceptualized pretty impulsively. it was a first-draft design that i got SO unbearably attached to that i just decided to make it the final one. but, as all first-draft concepts are, it is incredibly clunky and impractical. so many moving parts that a weapon could get caught in.
            but man idfk, it looks cool TO ME and is a blast to draw so that's all that matters imho. the impracticality actually lines up pretty well with his planet's philosophy pre-world-end, basically being so confident/so comfortable that they can AFFORD these inconveniences in order to keep up flashy appearances. they do NAWT think they can lose the war. turns out they can, and very spectacularly at that lol... they died as they lived.</p>

            <summary>i just think he has a cute looking face in general. like he is just so friend-shaped... i will
                never ever tire of drawing him ever. </summary>
