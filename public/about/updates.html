                    <p><strong>apr 13 '25</strong> &ndash; some quality of life changes. i rearranged a gazillion file paths so the 403 Forbidden nginx should stop randomly happening now... also i literally just realized i wasn't using absolute file paths in my js files so i fixed that too.</p>

                <h3>V3.3</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot5-3.png">
                <p>this doesn't look very different from the current site version (3.3.5). main difference is the headers, topbar, and button sizes are all larger, and the edges of the scrollable content are sharp and not round. there wasn't much reason to change the css from here - some elements just needed to be shrunken i think. oh yeah the grid in the background is also gone and so is the scrollable content's top margin.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>V3.2</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot5-2.png">
                <p>this screenshot and the next one are blurry as hell. unfortunately i don't have many screenshots of this era, this one was ripped straight from a neocities thumbnail. anyhow, i'd hardened the scrollable's edges and moved up the sidebar. not much else.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>V3.1</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot5-1.png">
                <p>AHH!! SANS-SERIF. IT'S BACK!! i'm testing out styling again, trying to figure out how to make the site softer without sacrificing the layout. i also thought that off-centering everything caused too much white space and so i centered everything again. this one's cluttered as hell</p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>V3.0</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot3.png">
                <p>i off-centered the sidebar and content box! i learned how to use the &lt;main&gt; tag and how to make it scrollable without containing it in a box like last time! wowie! i'm also using mono fonts now, and the borders of scrollables and images alike are weirdly inconsistent in thickness. but at least the code is better.</p>

                <h3>V2.5</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot2.png">
                <p>ackkkk.... i don't know why i decided to round the edges of the main content box, it completely ruined the vibe of the previous style i think. &#128557; i also started using sans-serif for some reason... i think i was trying to make the site easier to read/more appealing but the sharpness of the buttons and topbar clashed way too much to make it look good. kind of a flop tbh :\</p>
                <br>
                <h3>V2.0</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot2-1.png">
                <p>version 2.0 is my favorite out of all of the archives on this site. this was the start of the notebook theming and the use of thin fonts which would persist even into 2024. there's something about this look that's so warm and welcoming, i miss it a lot if i'm honest.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>V1</h3>
                <img src="../writing/images/microblog/screenshot.png">
                <p>ooo fun story about this first version: the topbar was meant to be a progress bar, where the further you scrolled down the page, the more of that minty color strip you'd see. i couldn't get it to work though and so the 100% brown and mint topbar stayed as is <small>&#128128;</small>. this metallic look didn't last for very long at all, i think i only created the doodle log, trad log, and first artblog before i ended up changing the color scheme drastically.</p>
