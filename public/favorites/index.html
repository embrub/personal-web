                <p>this is not a list of what i consider the "best" - but more of what currently inspires me 
                    at the moment. same goes for all other media on this page</p>
                <p>anyhow, i am not immune to spacing tf out and imagining elaborate scenes in my head while listening to
                    good songs. music is what drives a good chunk of my creative process nowadays and these
                    albums here are the main culprits. as a pantser, here are my essentials, ordered by what is
                    most relevant to me atm. additional links lead to their bandcamp pages, or the equivalent.</p>

                            <p>i found this album through the "skid vs larry" fight and ended up liking it a lot.
                                like, became my #1, <i>a lot</i>. "sweet melodies & edgy instrumentals," huh? what a
                                vibe. 90% of my OC inspo comes from here and looking at the lyrics i think it's v
                                obvious, haha </p>

                            <p>i derive a lot of frantic cornered fear and anger out of this album, which is just sometimes

                <p>a bit of a vague category, yeah? this is a showcase for medias whose narratives have greatly
                    effected me and the kinda stuff i wanna create. i say "medias" cos i don't wanna limit what
                    i decide to put in this section, even tho there's only 4 of them here right now, haha. anyways.
                    it's mostly horror stories [or horror-adjacent] that tend to stick with me, and it is horror that i
                    will share :}

                <p>kitty horrorshow's writing is a joy, her descriptions are so vivid and gross and intruiging. i
                    watched thru "lethargy hill" on youtube before i played the <a
                        href="https://kittyhorrorshow.itch.io/haunted-cities-v4" target="_blank">games</a>
                    that it was a part of. despite it being the least mechanically interesting and the most
                    simplistic story out of all of them, this one utterly captivated me.</p>
                <p>"there should be more here," huh. it's a story about a tormented and
                    disillusioned creator, and i guess its dreariness is something that drew me in. this might
                    just be me speaking out of my ass here, but this house feels so second-hand and it's so..... 
                    uncomfortable? idk if that makes sense, i hope u see my vision tho. &#128564;

                <p>this animation lives in my head rent free. three years and still, i can't get over the feelings
                    that overcame me when i first watched it, never can tire of it. it's the type of horror that isn't
                    scary per se, just sad and disheartening.</p>
                <p>this was the first vivinos animation i watched, and since then, they've only
                    created far more impressive works. if this seems like your cup of tea, i highly recommend

                <h3>FAITH: the unholy trinity</h3>
                <p>WHOAHHH. just wow, you know? these 3 games are up there for one of my favorite SERIES of
                    all time. FAITH is the story of a priest returning to the home where he failed
                    an exorcism years ago, an exorcism which still wracks him with guilt and nightmares. 
                    he attempts to finish the job and becomes entangled in the workings of a cult attempting to 
                    bring about the end. (image links to steam page)

                            chilling and intense the entire experience manages to be nonetheless. the kind of
                            storytelling
                            that lets your <i>brain</i> fill in the blanks. i have been infatuated with this series
                            since the first installation, and seeing it to completion was just so immensely satisfying 
                            and the payoff is so very "you deserve the rest" and. ohhhh my wary soul. pls play
                            game. i wish i could say more, though i refrain from spoiling. if you allow me to yap,
                            however...
                            <br><br>
                            the story to me, while it is a horror around the 80s satanic panic first, it is secondly 
                            an exploration about the battle with guilt, purpose and responsibility, trauma, and your 
                            own faith. the MC is SO COMPELLING-- so many bits to dissect. <s>my one

                        liked the inclusion of a "love angle" in a story before. it is also the first webtoon in years
                        that i've had the drive to binge-read all in one sitting. marionetta is such a wild and
                        refreshing blend of genres and aesthetics: soft fantasy, traveling circus coupe, mild cosmic horror,
                        corrupt government conspiracy. also..... you know i just love stories about immortality. if
                        you too love stories about strange deals to cheat death and the consequence of it all, you will
                        like marionetta. i like marionetta.

                        the eyes of a 15-year-old religious recluse, tobias schneien. while the opening quarter of the
                        comic’s dialogue is rather amateur, the character writing evolves into <strong>the best I have
                            ever read</strong>, especially from a comic which uneshamedlessly portrays messy aspects of
                        mental anguish. such complex and gray characters i love to observe. [<a

                        reaper, is forced to grapple with when assigned her new job-- to kill one sinner a day.
