                <p>it is what the title says it is. ddude...... hes so friend-shaped. i will never tire of drawing this
                    man.</p>
                <p>haha uh. speaking of "never growing tired"..... <strong>here is an expression meme template in which
                        i drew
                        him 10 times in a row</strong>
                    :sob emoji:</p>

                <p>just wanted to throw this one on this page too cos i dont think it's cool enough to deserve its own
                    lol. plus it p much falls undder the label of comfort doodle too, so!</p>
                <p>butyeah these were made on june 16. par0llel was doing them for her ocs and so i got a sudden burst
                    of inspiration to do my own as well. and uuuuuuuu idk, im happy w the colors but the expressions
                    themselves? not so much tbh. i purposefully held myself back from exaggerating them,,,, which is
                    kinda what the template is meant to be for,,, since canonically enzo's meant to be the kinda person 
                    who has muted expressions,,, but i kinda regret holding back since a lotta these ended up looking the 
                    same in the end. i swearr the sketch looked better lmaoooo </p>
