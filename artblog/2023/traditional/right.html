                <p>nothing terribly noteworthy about the drawing here other than maybe its aesthetics, but i still felt
                    like it was neat enough to share.</p> 
                <p>i made this one after being delivered some pretty harrowing news and
                    spending the weekend just angry and hyper-vigilant all around. i think u can tell pretty easily lol.
                    ive always been told it was theraputic to write down all your thoughts and then destroy them, but
                    never actually had the motive to do it until then, and ig it did its job. starting out making
                    something coherent and then scribbling & mutilating it till it's as ugly as what you got internally.
                    whatever. a few months later i dont even rlly remember what was meant to be written or even 100% 
                    the context, i just got this vaguely menacing yet somewhat aesthetic mess in my sketchbook to forget 
                    about. this thing is just mildly fascinating to me, what it represents and all.
